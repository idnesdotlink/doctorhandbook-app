      "indication": " 3TC, in combination with other anti-retroviral agents, is indicated for the treatment of HIV infected adults and children.",
      "dosage": "3TC therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.\n3TC can be taken with or without food. To ensure administration of the entire dose, the tablet(s) should ideally be swallowed without crushing. For patients who are unable to swallow tablets, lamivudine is available as an oral solution. Alternatively, the tablets may be crushed and added to a small amount of semisolid food or liquid, all of which should be consumed immediately.\nAdults and Adolescents Weighing at least 30 kg: The recommended dose is 300 mg daily. This may be administered as 150 mg (15 ml oral solution or 1 x 150 mg tablet) twice daily or 300 mg (30 ml oral solution or 2 x 150 mg tablet) once daily.\nChildren >3 months and Weighing <30 kg: Oral Solution: The recommended dose is 4 mg/kg twice daily up to a maximum of 300 mg daily.\nTablets: Children Weighing 21-30 kg: The recommended oral dose of lamivudine is ½ tablet (150 mg) taken in the morning and 1 whole tablet taken in the evening.\nChildren Weighing 14-21 kg: The recommended oral dose of lamivudine is ½ of a scored tablet taken twice daily.\nSince an accurate dosing cannot be achieved with this formulation, dosing according to weight bands is recommended for 3TC tablets. This dosing regimen for paediatric patients weighing 14-30 kg is based primarily on pharmacokinetic modelling, with supporting data from clinical studies.\nChildren <3 months: The limited data available are insufficient to propose specific dosage recommendations (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions).\nElderly: No specific data are available, however special care is advised in this age group due to age-associated changes eg, the decrease in renal function and alteration of hematological parameters.\nRenal Impairment: Lamivudine plasma concentrations (AUC) are increased in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment due to decreased clearance (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions). The dosage should therefore be reduced for patients with a creatinine clearance <50 mL/min. The same percentage reduction in dose applies for pediatric patients with renal impairment. When doses <150 mg are needed, the use of the oral solution is recommended. (See Tables 1 and 2.)\nHepatic Impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment unless accompanied by renal impairment (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions).",
      "over-dosage": "Symptoms: Limited data are available on the consequences of ingestion of acute overdoses in humans. No fatalities occurred, and the patients recovered. No specific signs or symptoms have been identified following such overdose.\nTreatment: If overdosage occurs, the patient should be monitored and standard supportive treatment applied as required. Since lamivudine is dialyzable, continuous hemodialysis could be used in the treatment of overdosage, although this has not been studied.",
      "administration": "May be taken with or without food.",
      "contra-indications": "The use of lamivudine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to lamivudine or to any ingredient of 3TC.",
      "special-precautions": "Lamivudine is not recommended for use as monotherapy.\nPatients should be advised that current antiretroviral therapy, including lamivudine, has not been proven to prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination. Appropriate precautions should continue to be employed.\nPatients receiving 3TC or any other antiretroviral therapy may continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection, and therefore they should remain under close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the treatment of patients with associated HIV diseases\nRenal Impairment: Lamivudine plasma concentrations (AUC) are increased in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment due to decreased clearance. The dose should therefore be adjusted (see Dosage and Administration).\nPancreatitis: Pancreatitis has been observed in some patients receiving lamivudine. However it is unclear whether this was due to treatment with the medicinal product or to the underlying HIV disease. Pancreatitis must be considered whenever a patient develops abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or elevated biochemical markers.\nDiscontinue use of lamivudine until diagnosis of pancreatitis is excluded.\nLactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of antiretroviral nucleoside analogues either alone or in combination, including lamivudine. A majority of these cases have been in women.\nClinical features which may be indicative of the development of lactic acidosis include generalized weakness, anorexia, and sudden unexplained weight loss, gastrointestinal symptoms and respiratory symptoms (dyspnea and tachypnea).\nCaution should be exercised when administering lamivudine to any patient and particularly to those with known risk factors for liver disease. Treatment with lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).\nFat Redistribution: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat, including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, elevated serum lipid and blood glucose levels have been observed either separately or together in some patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (see Adverse Reactions).\nWhilst all members of the PI and NRTI classes of medicinal products have been associated with one or more of these specific adverse events, linked to a general syndrome commonly referred to as lipodystrophy, data indicate that there are differences in the risk between individual members of the respective therapeutic classes.\nIn addition, the lipodystrophy syndrome has a multifactorial etiology; with for example HIV disease status, older age and duration of antiretroviral treatment all playing important, possibly synergistic roles.\nThe long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown.\nClinical examination should include evaluation for physical signs of fat redistribution. Consideration should be given to the measurement of serum lipids and blood glucose. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.\nImmune Reconstitution Syndrome: In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of ART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalized and/or focal mycobacterial infections and Pneumocystis jiroveci (P. carinii) pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms must be evaluated without delay and treatment initiated when necessary.\nPatients Co-Infected with Hepatitis B Virus: Clinical trial and marketed use of lamivudine, have shown that some patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) disease may experience clinical or laboratory evidence of recurrent hepatitis upon discontinuation of lamivudine, which may have more severe consequences in patients with decompensated liver disease. If lamivudine is discontinued in a patient with HIV and HBV co-infection, periodic monitoring of both liver function tests and markers of HBV replication should be considered.\nOral Solution: Diabetic patients should be advised that an adult dose contains sucrose 3 g.\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: There have been no studies to investigate the effect of 3TC on driving performance or the ability to operate machinery. Further, a detrimental effect on such activities cannot be predicted from the pharmacology of lamivudine. Nevertheless, the clinical status of the patient and the adverse event profile of 3TC should be borne in mind when considering the patient's ability to drive or operate machinery.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: There are limited data available on the safety of 3TC in human pregnancy. Studies in humans have confirmed that lamivudine crosses the placenta. Use in pregnancy should be considered only if the benefit outweighs the risk. Although the results of animal studies (see Toxicology under Actions) are not always predictive of human response, the findings in the rabbit suggest a potential risk of early embryonic loss.\nThere have been reports of mild, transient elevations in serum lactate levels, which may be due to mitochondrial dysfunction, in neonates and infants exposed in utero or peri-partum to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The clinical relevance of transient elevations in serum lactate is unknown. There have also been very rare reports of developmental delay, seizures and other neurological disease. However, a causal relationship between these events and NRTI exposure in utero or peri-partum has not been established. These findings do not affect current recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission of HIV.\nHealth experts recommend that where possible, women infected with HIV do not breastfeed their infants in order to avoid the transmission of HIV. Following oral administration, lamivudine was excreted in human breast milk at similar concentrations to those found in serum (1-8 mcg/mL). Since lamivudine and the virus pass into breast milk, it is recommended that mothers taking lamivudine do not breastfeed their infants.",
      "adverse-reactions": "The following events have been reported during therapy for HIV disease with 3TC alone and in combination with other anti-retroviral agents. With many still unclear whether they are related to the medicinal products or are as a result of the underlying disease process.\nThe following convention has been utilized for the classification of undesirable effects: Very common (>1/10); common (>1/100, <1/10); uncommon (>1/1000, <1/100); rare (>1/10,000, <1/1000); very rare (<1/10,000).\nBlood and Lymphatic Systems Disorders: Uncommon: Neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia. Very Rare: Pure red cell aplasia.\nMetabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Common: Hyperlactatemia. Rare: Lactic acidosis (see Precautions).\nRedistribution/Accumulation of Body Fat (see Precautions): The incidence of this event is dependent on multiple factors including the particular antiretroviral drug combination.\nNervous System Disorders: Common: Headache. Very Rare: Paresthesia. Peripheral neuropathy has been reported although a causal relationship to treatment is uncertain.\nGastrointestinal Disorders: Common: Nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, diarrhea. Rare: Pancreatitis, although a causal relationship to treatment is uncertain.

Rare: Rhabdomyolysis.\nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Common: Fatigue, malaise, fever.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": " The likelihood of interactions is low due to limited metabolism and plasma protein-binding and almost complete renal elimination of unchanged lamivudine.\nLamivudine is predominantly eliminated by active organic cationic secretion. The possibility of interactions with other medicinal products administered concurrently should be considered, particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system eg, trimethoprim. Other active substances (eg, ranitidine, cimetidine) are eliminated only in part by this mechanism and were shown not to interact with lamivudine.\nActive substances shown to be predominately excreted either via the active organic anionic pathway or by glomerular filtration are unlikely to yield clinically significant interactions with lamivudine.\nZidovudine: A modest increase in Cmax (28%) was observed for zidovudine when administered with lamivudine; however, overall exposure (AUC) was not significantly altered. Zidovudine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions).\nTrimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole: Administration of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg (co-trimoxazole) causes a 40% increase in lamivudine exposure because of the trimethoprim component. However, unless the patient has renal impairment, no dosage adjustment of 3TC is necessary (see Dosage and Administration). Lamivudine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim or sulfamethoxazole. The effect of co-administration of 3TC with higher doses of co-trimoxazole for the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and toxoplasmosis has not been studied.\nZalcitabine: Lamivudine may inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of zalcitabine when the 2 medicinal products are used concurrently. 3TC is therefore not recommended to be used in combination with zalcitabine.",

      "description": "The tablets are contained in a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a child resistant/tamper evident closure.",
      "mechanism": "Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Nucleoside analogue. ATC Code: J05AF05.\nPharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: Lamivudine is a potent, selective inhibitor of HIV-1 and HIV-2 replication in vitro. It is also active against zidovudine-resistant clinical isolates of HIV. Lamivudine is metabolized intracellularly to the 5'-triphosphate, the active moiety, which has an intracellular half-life of 16-19 hrs. Lamivudine 5'-triphosphate is a weak inhibitor of the RNA and DNA dependent activities of HIV reverse transcriptase; its main mode of action is as a chain terminator of HIV reverse transcription. Lamivudine has been shown to act additively or synergistically with other anti-HIV agents, particularly zidovudine, inhibiting the replication of HIV in cell culture.\nLamivudine does not interfere with cellular deoxynucleotide metabolism and has little effect on mammalian cell and mitochondrial DNA content.\nIn vitro, lamivudine demonstrates low cytotoxicity to peripheral blood lymphocytes, to established lymphocyte and monocyte-macrophage cell lines, and to a variety of bone marrow progenitor cells in vitro. Lamivudine therefore has, in vitro, a high therapeutic index.\nHIV-1 resistance to lamivudine involves the development of a M184V amino acid change close to the active site of the viral reverse transcriptase (RT). This variant arises both in vitro and in HIV-1 infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral therapy. M184V mutants display greatly reduced susceptibility to lamivudine and show diminished viral replicative capacity in vitro. In vitro studies indicate that zidovudine-resistant virus isolates can become zidovudine sensitive when they simultaneously acquire resistance to lamivudine. The clinical relevance of such findings remains, however, not well defined.\nCross-resistance conferred by the M184V RT is limited within the nucleoside inhibitor class of antiretroviral agents. Zidovudine and stavudine maintain their antiretroviral activities against lamivudine-resistant HIV-1. Abacavir maintains its antiretroviral activities against lamivudine-resistant HIV-1 harbouring only the M184V mutation. The M184V RT mutant shows a less than 4-fold decrease in susceptibility to didanosine and zalcitabine; the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. In vitro susceptibility testing has not been standardised and results may vary according to methodological factors.\nIn clinical trials, lamivudine in combination with zidovudine has been shown to reduce HIV-1 viral load and to increase CD4 cell count. Clinical end-point data indicate that lamivudine in combination with zidovudine alone or in combination with zidovudine containing treatment regimens results in a significant reduction in the risk of disease progression and mortality.\nReduced in vitro sensitivity to lamivudine has been reported for HIV isolates from patients who have received 3TC therapy.\nEvidence from clinical studies show that lamivudine plus zidovudine delays the emergence of zidovudine-resistant isolates in individuals with no prior anti-retroviral therapy.\nLamivudine has been widely used as a component of antiretroviral combination therapy with other antiretroviral agents of the same class (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) or different classes (protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors).\nMultiple drug antiretroviral therapy containing lamivudine has been shown to be effective in antiretrovirally-naive patients as well as in patients presenting with viruses containing the M184V mutations.\nThe relationship between in vitro susceptibility of HIV to lamivudine and the clinical response to therapy remain under investigation.\nPost-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP): Internationally recognised guidelines (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention - June 1998), recommend that in the event of accidental exposure to HIV infected blood eg, from a needlestick injury, a combination of zidovudine and lamivudine should be administered promptly (within 1-2 hrs). In cases of higher risk of infection a protease inhibitor should be included in the regimen. It is recommended that antiretroviral prophylaxis be continued for four weeks. No controlled clinical studies have been carried out in post-exposure prophylaxis and supporting data is limited. Seroconversion may still occur despite prompt treatment with antiretroviral agents.\nPharmacokinetics: Absorption: Lamivudine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and the bioavailability of oral lamivudine in adults is normally between 80% and 85%. Following oral administration, the mean time (tmax) to maximal serum concentrations (Cmax) is about an hour. At therapeutic dose levels ie, 4 mg/kg/day (as two 12-hourly doses), Cmax is in the order of 1-1.9 mcg/mL.\nCo-administration of lamivudine with food resulted in a delay of tmax and a lower Cmax (decreased by up to 47%). However, the extent (based on the AUC) of lamivudine absorbed was not influenced. No dose adjustment is needed when co-administered with food.\nTablets: Administration of two 150-mg tablets is bioequivalent to administration of one 300-mg tablet with respect to AUC8, Cmax and tmax.\nDistribution: From IV studies, the mean volume of distribution is 1.3 L/kg and the mean terminal half-life of elimination is 5-7 hrs.\nLamivudine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range and displays low plasma protein binding to albumin.\nLimited data shows lamivudine penetrates the central nervous system and reaches the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The mean lamivudine CSF/serum concentration ratio 2-4 hrs after oral administration was approximately 0.12. The true extent of penetration or relationship with any clinical efficacy is unknown.\nMetabolism and Elimination: Lamivudine mean systemic clearance is approximately 0.32 L/hr/kg, with predominantly renal clearance (>70%) via the organic cationic transport system and little (<10%) hepatic metabolism.\nThe active moiety, intracellular lamivudine triphosphate, has a prolonged terminal half-life in the cell (16-19 hrs) compared to the plasma lamivudine half-life (5-7 hrs). In 60 healthy adult volunteers, lamivudine 300 mg once daily has been demonstrated to be pharmacokinetically equivalent at steady-state to lamivudine 150 mg twice daily with respect to intracellular triphosphate AUC24 and Cmax.\nThe likelihood of adverse interactions between lamivudine and other medicinal products is low due to limited metabolism and plasma protein binding and almost complete renal elimination of unchanged lamivudine.\nSpecial Patient Populations: Children: In general, lamivudine pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients are similar to adults. However, absolute bioavailability (approximately 55-65%) was reduced in pediatric patients <12 years. In addition, systemic clearance values were greater in younger pediatric patients and decreased with age approaching adult values around 12 years.\nThere are limited pharmacokinetic data for patients <3 months. In neonates 1 week of age, lamivudine oral clearance was reduced when compared to pediatric patients and is likely to be due to immature renal function and variable absorption. Therefore to achieve similar adult and pediatric exposure, the recommended dose for neonates is 2 mg/kg twice a day. However there is no data available in neonates >1 week old.\nElderly: No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients >65 years.\nRenal Impairment: Lamivudine plasma concentrations (AUC) are increased in patients with renal dysfunction due to decreased clearance. The dosage should therefore be reduced for patients with a creatinine clearance of <50 mL/min (see Dosage and Administration).\nHepatic Impairment: Data obtained in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment show that lamivudine pharmacokinetics are not significantly affected by hepatic dysfunction.\nPregnancy: The pharmacokinetics of lamivudine are similar to that of non-pregnant adults. In humans, consistent with passive transmission of lamivudine across the placenta, lamivudine concentrations in infant serum at birth were similar to those in maternal and cord serum at delivery.\nToxicology: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis: Lamivudine was not mutagenic in bacterial tests but like many nucleoside analogues, showed activity in an in vitro cytogenetic assay and the mouse lymphoma assay.\nLamivudine was not genotoxic in vivo at doses that gave plasma concentrations around 40-50 times higher than the anticipated clinical plasma levels. As the in vitro mutagenic activity of lamivudine could not be confirmed in in vivo tests, it is concluded that 3TC should not represent a genotoxic hazard to patients undergoing treatment.\nThe results of long term oral carcinogenicity studies with lamivudine in rats and mice did not show any carcinogenic potential.\nReproductive Toxicology: Reproductive studies in animals have not shown evidence of teratogenicity and showed no effect on male or female fertility. Lamivudine produced small increases in early embryonic loss when administered to pregnant rabbits, at exposure levels comparable to those achieved in man. However, there was no evidence of embryonic loss in rats at exposure levels of approximately 35 times the clinical exposure (based on Cmax).\nAnimal Toxicology: Administration of lamivudine in animal toxicity studies at very high doses was not associated with any major organ toxicity. Reductions of erythrocyte and neutrophil counts were identified as the effects most likely to be of clinical relevance.",

However, formal interaction studies have not been performed.",
      "storage": " Store below 30°C.",
      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: Lamivudine is an antiviral agent, which is active against hepatitis B virus (HBV) both in vitro and in experimentally infected animals.\nLamivudine is metabolized by both infected and uninfected cells to the triphosphate (TP) derivative, which is the active form of the parent compound. The intracellular half-life of the triphosphate in hepatocytes is 17-19 hrs in vitro. Lamivudine-TP acts as an inhibitor of, and substrate for, the HBV viral polymerase. The formation of further viral DNA is blocked by incorporation of lamivudine-TP into the chain and subsequent chain termination.\nLamivudine-TP does not interfere with normal cellular deoxynucleotide metabolism. It is also only a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases a and ß. Furthermore, lamivudine-TP has little effect on mammalian cell DNA content.\nIn assays relating to potential drug effects on mitochondrial structure, DNA content and function, lamivudine lacked appreciable toxic effects. It has a very low potential to decrease mitochondrial DNA content, is not permanently incorporated into mitochondrial DNA and does not act as an inhibitor of mitochondrial DNA polymerase ?.\nPreclinical Virology: Lamivudine demonstrated potent anti-HBV activity in all cell lines tested with treatment resulting in reduced levels of viral DNA. The relationship between in vitro susceptibility of HBV to lamivudine and the clinical response to therapy has not been established.\nClinical Virology: Lamivudine has potent activity in vivo, reducing serum HBV DNA to undetectable levels within 2-4 weeks in most cases, and also reducing HBV DNA polymerase activity. Following short-term therapy (28 days) however, HBV DNA levels increased within 14 days of cessation of therapy.\nIn a clinical study, lamivudine therapy continued for 1 year was associated with sustained reductions in serum HBV DNA and ALT levels on therapy. There were also significant improvements in liver histology and necro-inflammatory activity. In addition, some patients experienced HBe antigen seroconversion by 1 year of lamivudine therapy. The efficacy of 3TC-HBV following longer term therapy is under investigation.\nLamivudine-resistant HBV has been detected in small percentage of patients by 1 year of therapy. A higher percentage of these emerged in immunosuppressed transplant patients than in immunocompetent carriers. This virus displays a reduced sensitivity to lamivudine in vitro. The clinical relevance of this resistance is yet to be determined.\nWhen lamivudine therapy is stopped in patients infected with resistant virus, lamivudine-sensitive HBV may rapidly reappear as the dominant species in circulation.\nPharmacokinetics: Absorption: Lamivudine is well absorbed from the gut and the bioavailability of oral lamivudine in adults is normally between 80% and 85%. Following oral administration, the mean time (Tmax) to maximal serum concentration (Cmax) is about 1 hr. At therapeutic dose levels ie, 100 mg once daily, Cmax is in the order of 1.1-1.5 mcg/mL. Co-administration of lamivudine with food generally results in a delay of Tmax by 0.25-2.5 hrs and a 10-40% reduction in Cmax. However, lamivudine bioavailability (based on AUC) is not altered, therefore, 3TC-HBV can be administered with or without food.\nDistribution: From IV studies, the mean volume of distribution is 1.3 L/kg. The mean systemic clearance of lamivudine is approximately 0.3 L/hr/kg, with predominantly renal clearance (>70%) via the organic cationic transport system. The observed dominant half-life of elimination is 5-7 hrs.\nLamivudine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range and displays limited binding to the major plasma protein albumin (<16% to 36% to serum albumin in vitro studies).\nLimited data shows lamivudine penetrates the central nervous system and reaches the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\nMetabolism: Lamivudine is predominantly cleared by renal excretion of unchanged drug. The likelihood of metabolic drug interactions with lamivudine is low due to the small (5-10%) extent of metabolism to a trans-sulphoxide derivative and the low plasma protein-binding.\nElimination: The majority of lamivudine is excreted unchanged in the urine. Renal clearance accounts for about 70% of the total clearance of lamivudine.\nSpecial Population: Studies in patients with renal impairment show lamivudine elimination is affected by renal dysfunction. Dose reduction in patients with a creatinine clearance of <30 mL/min is necessary.\nA study in hepatically impaired patients (non-HIV and non-HBV infected) showed lamivudine is well tolerated in this patient group with no changes in laboratory parameters or the adverse event profile of lamivudine. The pharmacokinetics of lamivudine are unaffected by hepatic impairment.\nLimited data in patients undergoing liver transplant show that impairment of hepatic function does not impact significantly on the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine unless accompanied by renal dysfunction.\nIn elderly patients, the pharmacokinetic profile of lamivudine suggests that normal aging with accompanying renal decline has no clinically significant effect on lamivudine exposure, except in patients with creatinine clearance of <30 mL/min.\nPreliminary data from a study in elderly but otherwise healthy subjects shows that elimination is reduced (increased half-life) and overall exposure (as AUC) increased with concomitant renal decline. The magnitude of the increase is less than double normal exposure thus not clinically significant.\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: Administration of lamivudine in animal toxicity studies at very high doses was not associated with any major organ toxicity. At the highest dosage levels, minor effects on the indicators of liver and kidney function were seen together with occasional reduction in liver weights.\nFollowing chronic administration at very high dose levels in rats and dogs, reduction in erythrocyte and neutrophil counts were identified as the events most likely to be of clinical relevance. However, at the therapeutic dose of 100 mg once daily in clinical trials, only a few cases of anemia and neutropenia have been reported.\nLamivudine was not mutagenic in bacterial tests but, like many nucleoside analogues showed activity in an in vitro cytogenetic assay and the mouse lymphoma assay. Lamivudine was not genotoxic in vivo at doses that gave plasma concentrations around 85 times higher than the anticipated clinical plasma levels. As the in vitro mutagenic activity of lamivudine could not be confirmed in in vivo tests, it is concluded that 3TC-HBV should not represent a genotoxic hazard to patients undergoing treatment.\nThe result of long-term carcinogenicity studies with lamivudine in rats and mice did not show any carcinogenic potential.",

Clarithromycin 500-mg immediate-release tablets may be utilized in this patient population.\nConcomitant administration of clarithromycin with any of the following drugs is contraindicated: Cisapride, pimozide and terfenadine and astemizole (see Interactions).\nWarnings Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including macrolides and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening.\nTherefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of Clostridium difficile which is the primary cause of \"antibiotic-associated colitis\". After the diagnosis, pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to discontinuation of the drug alone. In moderate to severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes, protein supplementation and treatment with an antibacterial drug effective against Clostridium difficile.\nUse in pregnancy: Clarithromycin should not be used in pregnant women, except in clinical circumstances where no alternative therapy is appropriate. If pregnancy occurs while taking clarithromycin, the patient should be informed of the potential hazards to the fetus. Clarithromycin has demonstrated adverse effects of pregnancy outcome and/or embryofetal development in monkeys, rats, mice and rabbits at doses that produced plasma levels 2-17 times the serum levels achieved in humans treated at the maximum recommended dose. (See Use in pregnancy under Precautions.)",
      "special-precautions": "Clarithromycin is principally excreted by the liver and kidney. Therefore, caution should be exercised in administering this antibiotic to patients with impaired hepatic function. Caution should also be exercised when administering clarithromycin to patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Clarithromycin may be administered without dosage adjustment to patients with hepatic impairment and normal renal function. However, in the presence of severe renal impairment with or without coexisting hepatic impairment, decreased dosage or prolonged dosing intervals may be appropriate.\nProlonged or repeated use of clarithromycin may result in an overgrowth of nonsusceptible bacteria or fungi. If superinfection occurs, clarithromycin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Attention should also be paid to the possibility of cross-resistance between clarithromycin and other macrolide drugs, as well as lincomycin and clindamycin.\nA pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that the concomitant administration of ritonavir 200 mg every 8 hrs and clarithromycin 500 mg every 12 hrs resulted in a marked inhibition of the metabolism of clarithromycin. The clarithromycin Cmax increased by 31%, Cmin increased 182% and AUC increased by 77% with concomitant administration of ritonavir. An essentially complete inhibition of the formation of 14-(R)-hydroxy clarithromycin was noted. Because of the large therapeutic window for clarithromycin, no dosage reduction should be necessary in patients with normal renal function. However, for patients with renal impairment, the following dosage adjustment should be reduced by 50%. For patients with creatinine clearance 30-60 mL/min, the dose of clarithromycin should be decreased by 75%. Doses of clarithromycin >1 g/day should not be co-administered with ritonavir.\nCarcinogenicity, Mutagenicity and Impairment of Fertility: The following in vitro mutagenicity test have been conducted with clarithromycin: Salmonella/mammalian microsome test, bacterial-induced mutation frequency tests, in vitro chromosome aberration test, rat hepatocyte DNA synthesis assay, mouse dominant lethal study, mouse lymphoma assay and mouse micronucleus test.\nAll tests had negative results except the in vitro chromosome aberration test, which was weakly positive in one test and negative in another.\nIn addition, a bacterial reverse mutation test (Ames test) has been performed on clarithromycin metabolites with negative results.\nFertility and reproduction studies have shown that daily doses of 150-160 mg/kg/day to male and female rats caused no adverse effects on the estrous cycle, fertility, parturition or number and viability of offspring. Plasma levels in rats after 150 mg/kg/day were 2 times the human serum levels.\nIn the 150 mg/kg/day monkey studies, plasma levels were 3 times the human serum levels. When given orally at 150 mg/kg/day, clarithromycin was shown to produce embryonic loss in monkeys. This effect has been attributed to marked maternal toxicity of the drug at this high dose.\nIn rabbits, in utero fetal loss occurred at an IV dose of 33 mg/m2, which is 17 times less than the maximum proposed human oral daily dose of 618 mg/m2. Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.\nUse in pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C: Four teratogenicity studies in rats (3 with oral doses and 1 with IV doses up to 160 mg/kg/day administered during the period of major organogenesis) and 2 in rabbits (at oral doses up to 125 mg/kg/day or IV doses of 30 mg/kg/day administered during gestation days 6-18) failed to demonstrate any teratogenicity from clarithromycin. Two additional oral studies in a different rat strain at similar doses and similar conditions demonstrated a low incidence of cardiovascular anomalies at doses of 150 mg/kg/day administered during gestation days 6-15. Plasma levels after 150 mg/kg/day were 2 times the human serum levels. Four studies in mice revealed a variable incidence of cleft palate following oral doses of 1000 mg/kg/day during gestation days 6-15. Cleft palate was also seen at 500 mg/kg/day. The 1000-mg/kg/day exposure resulted in plasma levels 17 times the human serum levels. In monkeys, an oral dose of 70 mg/kg/day produced fetal growth retardation at plasma levels that were 2 times the human serum levels.\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Clarithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. (See Warnings.)\nUse in lactation: It is not known whether clarithromycin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when clarithromycin is administered to nursing women. It is known that clarithromycin is excreted in the milk of lactating animals and that other drugs of this class are excreted in human milk.\nUse in children: Safety and effectiveness of clarithromycin in children <6 months have not been established and the safety of clarithromycin has not been studied in MAC patients <20 months.\nThere is insufficient evidence of efficacy to support the use of clarithromycin in acute bronchitis in young children.\nUse in the elderly: In a steady-state study in which healthy elderly subjects (65-81 years) were given 500 mg every 12 hrs, the maximum concentrations of clarithromycin and 14-OH clarithromycin were increased. The AUC was also increased. These changes in pharmacokinetics parallel known age-related decreases in renal functions. In clinical trials, elderly patients did not have an increased incidence of adverse events when compared to younger patients, dosage adjustment should be considered in the elderly patients with severe renal impairment.",
      "adverse-reactions": " The most frequently reported adverse effects of clarithromycin in clinical studies in adults were gastrointestinal-related complaints ie, tongue discolouration, oral moniliasis, hepatic abnormalities, nausea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, stomatitis and glossitis have been reported. Other side effects included headache, taste perversion and transient elevations of liver enzymes. The safety profile of the paediatric formulation is similar to that of the 250-mg tablet in adult patients.\nMetabolic/Nutritional: Increased serum creatinine and increased glutaryl transferase (GGT).\nImmunocompromised Patients: In adult patients, the most frequently reported adverse events by patients treated with total doses of clarithromycin 1000 mg and 2000 mg were nausea, vomiting, altered taste, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, flatulence, headache, constipation, hearing disturbance, and SGOT and SGPT elevations. Additional low-frequency events included dyspepsia, insomnia and dry mouth. The incidences were comparable for patients treated with 1000 and 2000 mg, but were generally about 3-4 times as frequent for those patients who received total daily doses of clarithromycin 4000 mg.\nPost-Marketing Experience: Hepatic dysfunction, including increased liver enzymes and hepatocellular and/or cholestatic hepatitis, with or without jaundice, has been infrequently reported with clarithromycin. This hepatic dysfunction may be severe and is usually reversible. In very rare instances, hepatic failure and fatal outcome has been reported and generally has been associated with serious underlying diseases and/or concomitant medications.\nAllergic reactions ranging from urticaria and mild skin eruptions to anaphylaxis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have occurred with orally administered clarithromycin.\nThere have been reports of transient central nervous system side effects including anxiety, dizziness, insomnia, hallucinations, bad dreams, confusion and psychosis. However, a cause-and-effect relationship has not been established.\nThere have been reports of hearing loss with clarithromycin, which is usually reversible upon withdrawal of therapy. Reports of alteration of the sense of smell, usually in conjunction with altered taste have also been reported.\nGlossitis, stomatitis, oral monilia and tongue discoloration have been reported with clarithromycin therapy. There have been reports of tooth discolouration in patients treated with clarithromycin. Tooth discolouration is usually reversible with professional dental cleaning.\nThere have been rare reports of hypoglycemia, some of which have occurred in patients on concomitant oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin.\nIsolated cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported. Rarely, erythromycin has been associated with ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and Torsade de pointes, individuals with prolonged QT intervals.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "Results of clinical studies indicate that there was a modest but statistically significant (p=0.05) increase of circulating theophylline or carbamazepine levels when either of these drugs are administered concomitantly with clarithromycin.\nClarithromycin use in patients who are receiving theophylline may be associated with an increase of serum theophylline concentrations. Monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations should be considered for patients receiving high doses of theophylline or with baseline concentrations in the upper therapeutic range. In 2 studies in which theophylline was administered with clarithromycin (a theophylline sustained-release formulation was dosed at either 6.5 or 12 mg/kg together with clarithromycin 250 or 500 mg every 12 hrs), the steady-state levels of Cmax, Cmin and area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) increased about 20%.\nSingle-dose administration of clarithromycin has been shown to result in increased concentrations of carbamazepine. Blood level monitoring of carbamazepine may be considered strain.\nAs with other macrolide antibiotics, the use of clarithromycin in patients concurrently taking drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 system (eg, digoxin, cyclosporine, disopyramide, ergot alkaloids, lovastatin, midazolam, phenytoin, triazolam and warfarin) may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these other drugs.\nElevated cisapride levels have been reported in patients receiving clarithromycin and cisapride concomitantly. This may result in QT prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and Torsade de pointes. Similar effects have been observed in patients taking clarithromycin and pimozide concomitantly. (See Contraindications.)\nMacrolides have been reported to alter the metabolism of terfenadine resulting in increased levels of terfenadine which has occasionally been associated with cardiac arrhythmias eg, QT prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and Torsade de pointes (see Contraindications). In 1 study in 14 healthy volunteers, the concomitant administration of clarithromycin and terfenadine resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in the serum level of the acid metabolites of terfenadine and in prolongation of the QT interval, which did not lead to any clinically detectable effect. Similar effects have been observed with concomitant administration of astemizole and other macrolides.\nSimultaneous oral administration of clarithromycin tablets and zidovudine to HIV-infected adult patients may result in decreased steady-state zidovudine concentrations. Because clarithromycin appears to interfere with the absorption of simultaneously administered oral zidovudine, this interaction can be largely avoided by staggering the doses of clarithromycin and zidovudine. This interaction does not appear to occur in pediatric HIV-infected patients taking clarithromycin suspension with zidovudine or dideoxyinosine.\nThe following drug interactions have not been reported in clinical trials with clarithromycin; however, they have been observed with erythromycin products: There have been reports of increased anticoagulant effects when erythromycin and oral anticoagulants were used concomitantly.\nConcurrent use of erythromycin and ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated in some patients with acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysesthesia.\nErythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and thus may increase the pharmacologic effect of triazolam.\nThe use of erythromycin in patients concurrently taking drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these other drugs. There have been reports of interactions of erythromycin with carbamazepine, cyclosporine, hexobarbital and phenytoin. Serum concentrations of drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 system should be monitored closely in patients concurrently receiving erythromycin.\nElevated digoxin serum concentrations have been reported in patients receiving clarithromycin and digoxin concomitantly. Monitoring of serum digoxin levels should be considered.",

Specifically, clarithromycin is 6-O-methyl erythromycin A.\nClarithromycin is a white to off-white antibiotic powder which is bitter, practically odorless, essentially insoluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol, methanol and acetonitrile. Its molecular formula is C38H69NO13 and the molecular weight is 747.96.",
      "mechanism": "Microbiology: Clarithromycin exerts its antibacterial action by binding to the 50s ribosomal subunits of susceptible bacteria and suppressing protein synthesis.\nClarithromycin has demonstrated in vitro activity against both standard strains of bacteria and clinical isolates. It is highly potent against a wide variety of aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of clarithromycin are generally 1 log 2 dilution more potent than the MICs of erythromycin.\nIn vitro data also indicate that clarithromycin has activity against Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It is bactericidal to Helicobacter pylori; this activity of clarithromycin is greater at neutral pH than at acid pH. In vitro and in vivo data show that this antibiotic has activity against clinically significant mycobacterial species.\nThe in vitro antibacterial spectrum of clarithromycin against respiratory tract and skin structure pathogens is as follows: Usually Sensitive Bacteria: Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus (Groups C, F and G), Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Listeria monocytogenes, Legionella pneumophila, Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Helicobacter (Campylobacter) pylori, Campylobacter jejuni, Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR), Chlamydia trachomatis, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Bordetella pertussis, Borrelia burgdorferi, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Peptococcus niger, Propionibacterium acnes, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium intracellulare and Mycobacterium kansasii.\nNonsensitive Bacteria: Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas sp.\nThe principal metabolite of clarithromycin in man and other primates is a microbiologically active metabolite, 14-OH-clarithromycin. This metabolite is as active or 1- to 2-fold less active than the parent compound for most organisms, except for H. influenzae against which it is twice as active. The parent compound and the 14-OH-metabolite exert either an additive or synergistic effect on H. influenzae in vitro and in vivo, depending on bacterial strains.\nClarithromycin was found to be 2-10 times more active than erythromycin in several experimental animal infection models. It was shown, for example, to be more effective than erythromycin in mouse systemic infection, mouse subcutaneous abscess and mouse respiratory tract infections caused by S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, S. pyogenes and H. influenzae.\nIn guinea pigs with Legionella infection, this effect was more pronounced; an intraperitoneal dose of clarithromycin 1.6 mg/kg/day was more effective than erythromycin 50 mg/kg/day.\nSusceptibility Testing: Diffusion Techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters give the most precise estimates of susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents. One recommended procedure uses discs impregnated with clarithromycin 15 mcg for testing susceptibility (Kirby-Bauer diffusion test); interpretations correlate inhibition zone diameters of this disc test with MIC values for clarithromycin. The MICs are determined by the broth or agar dilution method. The recommended test medium for susceptibility testing of Haemophilus influenzae according to the National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) is the Haemophilus Test Medium (HTM).\nThe correlation of disc inhibition zone diameters with MICs is given in Table 1.\nWith these procedures, a report from the laboratory of \"susceptible\" indicates that the infecting organism is likely to respond to therapy. A report of \"resistant\" indicates that the infective organism is not likely to respond to therapy. A report of \"intermediate susceptibility\" suggests that the therapeutic effect of the drug may be equivocal or that the organism would be susceptible if higher doses were used. (Intermediate susceptibility is also referred to as moderately susceptible.) This category provides a better zone, which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretations.\nHowever, standardized diffusion methods for routine in vitro susceptibility testing, using the 15-mcg clarithromycin disc, do not measure the additive antimicrobial activity of the 14-OH metabolite and thus may underestimate the drug's potential activity against Haemophilus influenzae isolates falling into the \"intermediate\" category which often respond to treatment.\nStandardized procedures require the use of laboratory control organisms. The 15-mcg clarithromycin disc should be given the following zone diameter: S. aureus ATCC 25923: 23-30 mm.\nDilution Techniques: Use a standardized dilution method (broth, agar, microdilution) or equivalent with clarithromycin powder. The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to the following criteria: Susceptible (S): =2 mcg/mL; intermediate (I): 4 mcg/mL; resistant (R): =8 mcg/mL.\nAs with standard diffusion techniques, dilution methods require the use of laboratory control organisms. Standard clarithromycin powder provide the following MIC values: S. aureus ATCC 29213: 0.06-0.25 mcg/mL; E. faecalis ATCC 29212: 0.25-1 mcg/mL.\nPharmacokinetics: The nonlinear kinetics of orally administered clarithromycin has been studied extensively in a number of animal species and human adults. These studies have shown that clarithromycin is readily and rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration with an absolute bioavailability of approximately 50%. No accumulation was found and the metabolic disposition did not change in any species following multiple dosing.\nFood delays both the onset of clarithromycin absorption and the formation of the antimicrobially active metabolite, 14-OH clarithromycin, but does not affect the extent of bioavailability. Therefore, Abbotic may be given without regard to meals.\nThe kinetics of orally administered clarithromycin modified-release (MR) has been studied in human adults and compared with clarithromycin 250- and 500-mg immediate-release tablets. The extent of absorption was found to be equivalent when equal daily doses were administered. The absolute bioavailability is approximately 50%. Little or no unpredicted accumulation was found and the metabolic disposition did not change in human following multiple dosing. Based upon the finding of equivalent extent of absorption, the following in vitro and in vivo data is also applicable to the modified-release formulation.\nIn vitro: Results of these animal studies showed that clarithromycin levels in all tissues, except the central nervous system, were several times higher than the circulating drug levels. The highest concentrations were usually found in the liver and lung where the tissue to plasma (T/P) ratios reached 10-20.\nIn vivo: In vivo studies showed that the protein binding of clarithromycin in human plasma averaged about 70% at concentrations of 0.45-4.5 mcg/mL. A decrease in binding to 41% at 45 mcg/mL suggested that the binding sites might become saturated, but this only occurred at concentrations far in excess of the therapeutic drug levels.\nClarithromycin and its 14-OH metabolite distributed readily into body tissues and fluids. Limited data from a small number of patients suggests that clarithromycin does not achieve significant levels in cerebrospinal fluid after oral doses (ie, only 1-2% of serum levels in CSF in patients with normal blood-CSF barriers). Concentrations in tissues are usually several folds higher than serum concentrations. Examples from tissue and serum concentrations are presented in Table 2.\nIn fasting healthy human subjects, peak serum concentrations were attained within 2 hrs after oral dosing. With twice-daily dosing at 250 mg, the peak steady-state plasma concentration was attained in 2-3 days and averaged about 1 mcg/mL for clarithromycin and 0.6 mcg/mL for 14-hydroxy clarithromycin, while the elimination half-lives of the parent drug and metabolite were 3-4 and 5-6 hrs, respectively.\nWith twice-daily dosing at 500 mg, the steady-state Cmax for clarithromycin and its hydroxylated metabolite averaged 2.7-2.9 and 0.88-0.83 mcg/mL, respectively. The half-life of the parent drug at the 500-mg dose level was 4.5-4.8 hrs, while that of the 14-hydroxy clarithromycin was 6.9-8.7 hrs. At steady state, the 14-hydroxy clarithromycin levels did not increase proportionately with the clarithromycin dose and the apparent half-lives of both clarithromycin and its hydroxylated metabolite tended to be longer at the higher doses. This nonlinear pharmacokinetic behavior of clarithromycin, coupled with the overall decrease in the formation of 14-hydroxylation and N-demethylation products at the higher doses, indicates that metabolism of clarithromycin approaches saturation at high doses.\nThe nonlinearity of clarithromycin pharmacokinetics is slight at the recommended doses of 250 mg and 500 mg administered every 12 hrs.\nAfter a 250-mg tablet is administered every 12 hrs, approximately 20% of the dose is excreted in the urine is clarithromycin. After a 500-mg tablet every 12 hrs dosing, the urinary excretion of clarithromycin is somewhat greater, approximately 30%. The renal clearance of clarithromycin is, however, relatively independent of the dose size and approximates the normal glomerular filtration rate. The major metabolite found in urine is 14-OH clarithromycin which accounts for an additional 10-15% of the dose with either 250 or 500 mg administered every 12 hrs.\nA pharmacokinetic study was conducted with clarithromycin 500 mg 3 times daily and omeprazole 40 mg 4 once daily. When clarithromycin was given alone at 500 mg every 8 hrs, the mean steady-state Cmax value was approximately 31% higher and the mean Cmin value was approximately 119% higher than when clarithromycin is compared with a previous study at 500 mg every 12 hrs. The mean AUC0-24 for clarithromycin was >65% greater when clarithromycin 500 mg was given every 8 hrs than every 12 hrs. Neither Tmax nor half-life values appeared substantially different between the 8- and 12-hourly regimens.\nWhen clarithromycin was administered with omeprazole, increases omeprazole's half-life and AUC0-24 were observed. For all subjects combined, the mean omeprazole AUC0-24 was 89% greater and the harmonic mean for omeprazole t½ was 34% greater when omeprazole was administered with clarithromycin than when omeprazole was administered alone. On the other hand, the steady-state Cmax, Cmin and AUC0-8 of clarithromycin were increased by 10%, 27% and 15%, respectively, over values achieved when clarithromycin was administered with placebo.\nAt steady state, clarithromycin gastric mucus concentrations 6-hr post-dosing were approximately 25-fold higher in the clarithromycin/omeprazole group compared with the clarithromycin-alone group. Six hours post-dosing, mean clarithromycin gastric tissue concentrations were approximately 2-fold higher when clarithromycin was given with omeprazole than when clarithromycin was given with placebo.\nIn human adults given single oral doses of clarithromycin 250 or 1200 mg, urinary excretion accounted for 37.9% of the lower dose and 46% of the higher dose. Fecal elimination accounted for 40.2% and 29.1% of these respective doses.\nIn fed patients given clarithromycin MR 500 mg once daily, the peak steady-state plasma concentration of clarithromycin and 14-hydroxy clarithromycin were 1.3 mcg/mL and 0.48 mcg/mL, respectively. Elimination half-lives of the parent drug and metabolite were approximately 5.3 hrs and 7.7 hrs, respectively. When clarithromycin MR 1000 mg once daily (2 x 500 mg) was administered, the steady-state Cmax for clarithromycin and its hydroxylated metabolite averaged 2.4 mcg/mL and 0.67 mcg/mL, respectively. The half-life, while that of the 14-hydroxy clarithromycin was approximately 8.9 hrs of the parent drug at the 1000-mg dose level was approximately 5.8 hrs. The Tmax for both the 500- and 1000-mg doses was approximately 6 hrs. At steady state, the 14-hydroxy clarithromycin levels did not increase proportionately with the clarithromycin dose and the apparent half-lives of both clarithromycin and its hydroxylated metabolite tended to be longer at the higher doses. This nonlinear pharmacokinetic behavior of clarithromycin, coupled with the overall decrease in the formation of 14-hydroxylation and N-demethylation products at the higher doses, indicates that the nonlinear metabolism of clarithromycin becomes more pronounced at high doses.\nUrinary excretion accounts for approximately 40% of the clarithromycin dose. Fecal elimination accounts for approximately 30%.\nHepatic Impairment: In a study comparing 1 group of healthy human subjects with a group of subjects with liver impairment who were given clarithromycin/clarithromycin immediate-release 250 mg twice daily for 2 days and a single 250-mg dose the 3rd day, steady-state plasma levels and systemic clearing of clarithromycin were not significantly different between the 2 groups. In contrast, steady-state concentrations of the 14-OH metabolite were markedly lower in the group of hepatically impaired subjects. This decreased metabolic clearance of the parent compound by 14-hydroxylation was partially offset by an increase in the renal clearance of parent drug, resulting in comparable steady-state levels of parent drug in the hepatically impaired and healthy subjects. These results indicate that no adjustment of dosage is necessary for subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment but with normal renal function.\nRenal Impairment: A study was conducted to evaluate and compare the pharmacokinetic profile of multiple 500-mg oral doses of clarithromycin/clarithromycin immediate-release in subjects with normal and decreased renal function. The plasma levels, half-life, Cmax and Cmin for both clarithromycin and its 14-OH metabolite were higher and AUC was larger in subjects with renal impairment. Potassium elimination and urinary excretion were lower. The extent to which these parameters differed was correlated with the degree of renal impairment; the more severe the renal impairment, the more significant the difference (see Dosage and Administration and Contraindications).\nElderly: A study was also conducted to evaluate and compare the safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of multiple 500-mg oral doses of clarithromycin/clarithromycin immediate-release in healthy elderly male and female subjects to those in healthy young adult male subjects. In the elderly group, circulating plasma levels were higher and elimination slower than in the younger group for both parent drug and 14-OH metabolite. However, there was no difference between the 2 groups when renal clearance was correlated with creatinine clearance. It is concluded from those result that any effect on the handling of clarithromycin is related to renal function and not to age per se.",

The efficacy of Abilify in maintaining stability in patients with schizophrenia who had been symptomatically stable on other antipsychotic medications for periods of =3 months were discontinued from those other medications, and were then administered Abilify 15 mg/day and observed for relapse during a period of up to 26 weeks was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial (see Pharmacology under Actions). The physician who elects to use Abilify for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of Abilify for the individual patient (see Dosage and Administration).\nBipolar Disorder: Treatment of acute manic and mixed epithelial episodes associated with bipolar disorder. The efficacy of Abilify was established in 2 placebo-controlled trials (3 weeks) of inpatient with DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder who were expecting an acute manic or mixed episodes with or without psychotic features (see Pharmacology under Actions). The efiicacy of Abilify in maintaining efficacy in patients with bipolar I disorder with a recent manic or mixed episode who had been stabilized and then maintained for at least 6 weeks was demonstrated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Prior to entering the double-blind, randomization phase of this trial, patients were clinically stabilized for 6 consecutive weeks on Abilify. Following this 6-week maintenance phase, patients were randomized to either placebo or Abilify and monitored for relapse (see Pharmacology under Actions).\nPhysicians who elect to use Abilify for extended periods ie, >6 weeks, should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see Dosage and Administration).\nAdjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder.",
      "dosage": "Schizophrenia: Recommended Starting and Target Dose: 10 or 15 mg once a day without regard to meals. Abilify has been systematically evaluated and shown to be effective in a dose range of 10-30 mg/day, when administered as a tablet formulation; however, doses >10 or 15 mg/day, the lowest doses in these trials, were not more effective than 10 or 15 mg/day. Dosage increases should be made before 2 weeks, the time needed to achieve steady state.\nSpecial Populations: Dosage adjustments are not routinely indicated on the basis of age, gender, race or renal or hepatic impairment status (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions).\nDosage Adjustments: Patients Taking Aripiprazole Concomitantly with Potential CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors: When concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inhibitor eg, ketoconazole and potential CYP2D6 inhibitors eg, quinidine, fluoxetine or paroxetine with aripiprazole occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to ½ of the usual dose. When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased.\nPatients Taking Potential CYP3A4 Inducers: When a potential CYP3A4 inducer eg, carbamazepine is added to aripiprazole therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be doubled (to 20-30 mg). Additional dose increases should be based on clinical evaluation. When carbamazepine is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to 10-15 mg.\nMaintenance Therapy: While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long a patient treated with aripiprazole should remain on it, systematic evaluation of patients with schizophrenia who had been symptomatically stable on other antipsychotic medications for periods of =3 months were discontinued from those medications, and were then administered Abilify 15 mg/day and observed for relapse during a period of up to 26 weeks, demonstrated a benefit of such maintenance treatment (see Pharmacology under Actions). Patients should periodically be reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.\nSwitching From Other Antipsychotics: There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients with schizophrenia from other antipsychotics to Abilify or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients with schizophrenia, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized.\nBipolar Disorder: Usual Starting Dose: 30 mg once a day. A dose of 30-mg/day was found to be effective when administered as the tablet formulation. Approximately 15% of patients had their dose decreased to 15 mg based on assessment of tolerability. The safety of doses >30 mg/day has not been evaluated in clinical trials.\nSpecial Populations: See Schizophrenia.\nMaintenance Therapy: While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long a patient treated with aripiprazole should remain on it, patients with bipolar I disorder who had been symptomatically stable on Abilify tablets (15 or 30 mg/day with a starting dose of 30 mg/day) for at least 6 consecutive weeks and then randomized to Abilify (15 or 30 mg/day) or placebo, and monitored for relapse demonstrated a benefit of such maintenance treatment (see Pharmacology under Actions). While it is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment beyond an acute response in mania is desirable, both for maintenance of the initial response and for prevention of new manic episodes, there are no systematically obtained data to support the use of aripiprazole in such longer-term treatment (ie, beyond 6 weeks).",
      "over-dosage": "MedDRA terminology has been used to classify the adverse events.\nHuman Experience: A total of 76 cases of deliberate or accidental overdosage with aripiprazole have been reported worldwide. These include overdoses with aripiprazole alone and in combination with other substances. No fatality was reported from these cases. Of the 44 cases with known outcome, 33 recovered without sequelae and 1 recovered with sequelae (mydriasis and feeling abnormal). The largest known acute ingestion with a known outcome involved 1080 mg of aripiprazole (36 times the maximum recommended daily dose) in a patient who fully recovered. Included in the 76 cases are 10 cases of deliberate or accidental overdosage in children (=12 years) involving aripiprazole ingestions up to 195 mg with no fatalities.\nSymptoms: Common adverse events (reported in at least 5% of all overdose cases) reported with aripiprazole overdosage (alone or in combination with other substances) include vomiting, somnolence and tremor. Other clinically important signs and symptoms observed in =1 patients with aripiprazole overdoses (alone or with other substances) include acidosis, aggression, increased aspartate aminotransferase, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, coma, confusional state, convulsion, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, depressed level of consciousness, hypertension, hypokalaemia, hypotension, lethargy, loss of consciousness, prolonged QRS complex, prolonged QT, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory arrest, status epilepticus and tachycardia.\nTreatment: No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with aripiprazole. An electrocardiogram should be obtained in case of overdosage and, if QTc interval prolongation is present, cardiac monitoring should be instituted. Otherwise, management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.\nCharcoal: In the event of an overdose of Abilify, an early charcoal administration may be useful in partially preventing the absorption of aripiprazole. Administration of activated charcoal 50 g, 1 hr after a single 15-mg oral dose of aripiprazole, decreased the mean AUC and Cmax of aripiprazole by 50%.\nHemodialysis: Although there is no information on the effect of hemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, hemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.",
      "administration": "May be taken with or without food.",
      "contra-indications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to aripiprazole.\nWarnings Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis: Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks) in these patients revealed a risk of death in the drug-treated patients of between 1.6-1.7 times that seen in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (eg, heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (eg, pneumonia) in nature. Abilify is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including aripiprazole. Two possible cases of NMS occurred during aripiprazole treatment in the premarketing worldwide clinical database. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.\nThe diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (eg, pneumonia, systemic infection, etc) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system pathology.\nThe management of NMS should include: Immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.\nIf a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.\nTardive Dyskinesia: A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. It is unknown whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia.\nThe risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses.\nThere is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and, thereby, may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.\nGiven these considerations, Abilify should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs and for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.\nIf signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on Abilify, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with Abilify despite the presence of the syndrome.\nCerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis: In placebo-controlled clinical studies (2 flexible dose and 1 fixed dose study) of dementia-related psychosis, there was an increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events (eg, stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, in aripiprazole-treated patients (Mean Age: 84 years; Range: 78-88 years). In the fixed-dose study, there was a statistically significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole. Aripiprazole is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis (see Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness: Safety Experience in Elderly Patients with Psychosis Associated with Alzheimer’s Disease under Precautions).\nHyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Hypergylcemia, in some extreme cases and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. There have been few reports of hyperglycemia in patients treated with Abilify. Although fewer patients have been treated with Abilify, it is not known if this more limited experience is the sole reason for the paucity of such reports. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies which did not include Abilify suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics included in these studies. Because Abilify was not marketed at the time these studies were performed, it is not known if Abilify is associated with this increased risk. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia related adverse events in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.\nPatients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (eg, obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of antidiabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspected drug.",
      "special-precautions": "General: Orthostatic Hypotension: Aripiprazole may be associated with orthostatic hypotension, perhaps due to its a1-adernergic receptor antagonism. The incidence of orthostatic hypotension-associated events from 5 short-term, placebo-controlled trials in schizophrenia (n=926) on Abilify included: Orthostatic hypotension (placebo 1%, aripiprazole 1.9%), orthostatic lightheadedness (placebo 1%, aripiprazole 0.9%), and syncope (placebo 1%, aripiprazole 0.6%). The incidence of orthostatic hypotension-associated events from short-term, placebo-controlled trials in bipolar mania (n=597) on Abilify included: Orthostatic hypotension (placebo 0%, aripiprazole 0.7%), orthostatic lightheadedness (placebo 0.5%, aripiprazole 0.5%), and syncope (placebo 0.9%, aripiprazole 0.5%).\nThe incidence of a significant orthostatic change in blood pressure (defined as a decrease of at least 30 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure when changing from a supine to standing position) for aripiprazole was not statistically different from placebo (in schizophrenia: 14% among aripiprazole-treated patients and 12% among placebo-treated patients and in bipolar mania: 3% among aripiprazole-treated patients and 2% among placebo-treated patients).\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications).\nSeizure: Seizures occurred in 0.1% (1/926) of aripiprazole-treated patients with schizophrenia in short-term, placebo-controlled trials. In short-term, placebo-controlled clinical trials of patients with bipolar mania, 0.3% (2/597) of aripiprazole-treated patients and 0.2% (1/436) of placebo-treated patients experienced seizures. As with other antipsychotic drugs, aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold eg, Alzheimer's dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of >65 years.\nPotential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment: In short-term, placebo-controlled trials of schizophrenia, somnolence was reported in 11% of patients on Abilify compared to 8% of patients on placebo; somnolence led to discontinuation in 0.1% (1/926) of patients with schizophrenia on Abilify in short-term, placebo-controlled trials. In short-term, placebo-controlled trials of bipolar mania, somnolence was reported in 14% of patients on Abilify compared to 7% of patients on placebo, but did not lead to discontinuation of any patients with bipolar mania. Despite the relatively modest increased incidence of somnolence compared to placebo, Abilify, like other antipsychotics, may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking or motor skills. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with Abilify does not affect them adversely.\nBody Temperature Regulation: Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing aripiprazole for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature eg, exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity or being subject to dehydration.\nDysphagia: Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia (see Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness as follows).\nSuicide: The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illnesses and bipolar disorder, and close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for Abilify should be written for the smallest quantity consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose.\nUse in Patients with Concomitant Illness: Clinical experience with Abilify in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses (see Pharmacokinetics: Special Populations: Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment under Actions) is limited.\nAbilify has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from pre-marketing clinical studies.\nSafety Experience in Elderly Patients with Psychosis Associated with Alzheimer's Disease: In 3, 10-week, placebo-controlled studies of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease (n=938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years), the treatment-emergent adverse events that were reported at an incidence of =5% and aripiprazole incidence at least twice that for placebo were asthenia (placebo 3%, aripiprazole 8%), somnolence (placebo 3%, aripiprazole 9%), urinary incontinence (placebo 1%, aripiprazole 5%), excessive salivation (placebo 0%, aripiprazole 4%), and lightheadedness (placebo 1%, aripiprazole 4%).\nThe safety and efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of patients with psychosis associated with dementia have not been established. If the prescriber elects to treat such patients with Abilify, vigilance should be exercised, particularly for the emergence of difficulty in swallowing or excessive somnolence, which could predispose to accidental injury or aspiration (see also Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis and Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis under Warnings).\nInformation for Patients: Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe Abilify: Concomitant Medication: Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions.\nAlcohol: Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking Abilify.\nHeat Exposure and Dehydration: Patients should be advised regarding appropriate care in avoiding overheating and dehydration.\nDrug Abuse and Dependence: Controlled Substance: Abilify is not a controlled substance.\nAbuse and Dependence: Aripiprazole has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance or physical dependence. In physical dependence studies in monkeys, withdrawal symptoms were observed upon abrupt cessation of dosing. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drug-seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse and such patients should be observed closely for signs of Abilify misuse or abuse (eg, development of tolerance, increases in dose, drug-seeking behavior).\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Because aripiprazole may have the potential to impair judgment, thinking or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole therapy does not affect them adversely.\nCarcinogenicity, Mutagenicity and Impairment of Fertility: Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted in ICR mice and in Sprague-Dawley (SD) and F344 rats. Aripiprazole was administered for 2 years in the diet at doses of 1, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day to ICR mice and 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg/day to F344 rats [0.2-5 and 0.3-3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on mg/m2, respectively]. In addition, SD rats were dosed orally for 2 years at 10, 20, 40 and 60 mg/kg/day (3-19 times the MRHD based on mg/m2). Aripiprazole did not induce tumors in male mice or rats. In female mice, the incidences of pituitary gland adenomas and mammary gland adenocarcinomas and adenoacanthomas were increased at dietary doses of 3-30 mg/kg/day (0.1-0.9 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC and 0.5-5 times the MRHD based on mg/m2). In female rats, the incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas was increased at a dietary dose of 10 mg/kg/day (0.1 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC and 3 times the MRHD based on mg/m2); and the incidences of adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/carcinomas were increased at an oral dose of 60 mg/kg/day (14 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC and 19 times the MRHD based on mg/m2).\nProliferative changes in the pituitary and mammary gland of rodents have been observed following chronic administration of other antipsychotic agents and are considered prolactin-mediated. Serum prolactin was not measured in the aripiprazole carcinogenicity studies. However, increases in serum prolactin levels were observed in female mice in a 13-week dietary study at the doses associated with mammary gland and pituitary tumors. Serum prolactin was not increased in female rats in 4- and 13-week dietary studies at the dose associated with mammary gland tumors. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown.\nThe mutagenic potential of aripiprazole was tested in the in vitro bacterial reverse-mutation assay, the in vitro bacterial DNA repair assay, the in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells, the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells, the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice and the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in rats. Aripiprazole and a metabolite (2,3-DCPP) were clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in CHL cells with and without metabolic activation. The metabolite 2,3-DCPP, produced increases in numerical aberrations in the in vitro assay in CHL cells in the absence of metabolic activation. A positive response was obtained in the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice, however, the response was shown to be due to a mechanism not considered relevant to humans.\nFemale rats were treated with oral doses of 2, 6 and 20 mg/kg/day (0.6, 2 and 6 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) of aripiprazole from 2 weeks prior to mating through day 7 of gestation. Estrous cycle irregularities and increased corpora lutea were seen at all doses, but no impairment of fertility was seen. Increased preimplantation loss was seen at 6 and 20 mg/kg and decreased fetal weight was seen at 20 mg/kg.\nMale rats were treated with oral doses of 20, 40 and 60 mg/kg/day (6, 13 and 19 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) of aripiprazole from 9 weeks prior to mating through mating. Disturbances in spermatogenesis were seen at 60 mg/kg and prostate atrophy was seen at 40 and 60 mg/kg, but no impairment of fertility was seen.\nUse in pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C: In animal studies, aripiprazole demonstrated developmental toxicity, including possible teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits.\nPregnant rats were treated with oral doses of 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (1, 3 and 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) of aripiprazole during the period of organogenesis. Gestation was slightly prolonged at 30 mg/kg. Treatment caused a slight delay in fetal development, as evidenced by decreased fetal weight (30 mg/kg), undescended testes (30 mg/kg) and delayed skeletal ossification (10 and 30 mg/kg). There were no adverse effects on embryofetal or pup survival. Delivered offspring had decreased body weights (10 and 30 mg/kg) and increased incidences of hepatodiaphragmatic nodules and diaphragmatic hernia at 30 mg/kg (the other dose groups were not examined for these findings). A low incidence of diaphragmatic hernia was also seen in the fetuses exposed to 30 mg/kg. Postnatally, delayed vaginal opening was seen at 10 and 30 mg/kg and impaired reproductive performance (decreased fertility rate, corpora lutea, implants and live fetuses, and increased post-implantation loss, likely mediated through effects on female offspring) was seen at 30 mg/kg. Some maternal toxicity was seen at 30 mg/kg, however, there was no evidence to suggest that these developmental effects were secondary to maternal toxicity.\nPregnant rabbits were treated with oral doses of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day (2, 3 and 11 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC and 6, 19 and 65 times the MRHD based on mg/m2) of aripiprazole during the period of organogenesis. Decreased maternal food consumption and increased abortions were seen at 100 mg/kg. Treatment caused increased fetal mortality (100 mg/kg), decreased fetal weight (30 and 100 mg/kg), increased incidence of a skeletal abnormality (fused sternebrae at 30 and 100 mg/kg) and minor skeletal variations (100 mg/kg).\nIn a study in which rats were treated with oral doses of 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day (1, 3 and 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) of aripiprazole perinatally and postnatally (from day 17 of gestation through day 21 postpartum), slight maternal toxicity and slightly prolonged gestation were seen at 30 mg/kg. An increase in stillbirths, and decreases in pup weight (persisting into adulthood) and survival, were seen at this dose.\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It is not known whether aripiprazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Aripiprazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.\nPatients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with Abilify.\nLabor and Delivery: The effect of aripiprazole on labor and delivery in humans is unknown.\nUse in lactation: Aripiprazole was excreted in milk of rats during lactation. It is not known whether aripiprazole or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. It is recommended that women receiving aripiprazole should not breastfeed.\nUse in children: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric and adolescent patients have not been established.\nUse in the elderly: Of the 7951 patients treated with aripiprazole in premarketing clinical trials, 991 (12%) were =65 years and 789 (10%) were =75 years. The majority (88%) of the 991 patients were diagnosed with dementia of the Alzheimer's type.\nPlacebo-controlled studies of aripiprazole in schizophrenia or bipolar mania did not include sufficient numbers of subjects =65 years to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. There was no effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of a single 15-mg dose of aripiprazole. Aripiprazole clearance was decreased by 20% in elderly subjects =65 years) compared to younger adult subjects (18-64 years), but there was no detectable effect of age in the population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenia patients.\nStudies of elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer’s disease have suggested that there may be a different tolerability profile in this population compared to younger patients with schizophrenia (see Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis and Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis under Warnings and Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness under Precautions). The safety and efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer’s disease has not been established. If the prescriber elects to treat such patients with Abilify, vigilance should be exercised.",
      "adverse-reactions": "Aripiprazole has been evaluated for safety in 7951 patients who participated in multiple-dose, premarketing trials in schizophrenia, bipolar mania and dementia of the Alzheimer's type, and who had approximately 5235 patient-years of exposure. A total of 2280 aripiprazole-treated patients were treated for at least 180 days and 1558 aripiprazole-treated patients had at least 1 year of exposure.\nThe conditions and duration of treatment with aripiprazole included (in overlapping categories) double-blind, comparative and noncomparative open-label studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed- and flexible-dose studies, and short- and longer-term exposure.\nAdverse events during exposure were obtained by collecting volunteered adverse events, as well as results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses and ECG. Adverse experiences were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. In the tables and tabulations that follow, modified COSTART dictionary terminology has been used initially to classify reported adverse events into a smaller number of standardized event categories, in order to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events.\nThe stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. There was no attempt to use investigator causality assessments ie, all reported events are included.\nThe prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatment, uses and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidence in the population studied.\nAdverse Findings Observed in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials of Patients with Schizophrenia: The following findings are based on a pool of 5 placebo-controlled trials (four 4-week and one 6-week) in which aripiprazole was administered in doses ranging from 2-30 mg/day.\nAdverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials: Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events between aripiprazole-treated (7%) and placebo-treated (9%) patients. The types of adverse events that led to the discontinuation were similar between the aripiprazole- and placebo-treated patients.\nAdverse Findings Observed in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials of Patients with Bipolar Mania: The following findings are based on a pool of 3-week, placebo-controlled, bipolar mania trials in which aripiprazole was administered at doses of 15 or 30 mg/day.\nAdverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials: Overall, in patients with bipolar mania, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events between aripiprazole-treated (11%) and placebo-treated (9%) patients. The types of adverse events that led to discontinuation were similar between the aripiprazole and placebo-treated patients.\nCommonly Observed Adverse Events in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials of Patients with Bipolar Mania: Commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of aripiprazole in patients with bipolar mania (incidence of =5% and aripiprazole incidence at least twice that for placebo) are shown in Table 1. There were no adverse events in the short-term trials of schizophrenia that met these criteria (see Table 1).\nAdverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of =2% Among Aripiprazole-Treated Patients and Greater Than Placebo in Short-Term Placebo-Controlled Trials: Table 2 enumerates the pooled incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks in schizophrenia and up to 3 weeks in bipolar mania), including only those events that occurred in =2% of patients treated with aripiprazole (doses =2 mg/day) and for which the incidence in patients treated with aripiprazole was greater than the incidence in patients treated with placebo in the combined dataset (see Table 2).\nAn examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential adverse event incidence on the basis of age, gender or race.\nDose-Related Adverse Events: Schizophrenia: Dose response relationships for the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events were evaluated from 4 trials in patients with schizophrenia comparing various fixed doses (2, 10, 15, 20 and 30 mg/day) of aripiprazole to placebo. This analysis, stratified by study, indicated that the only adverse event to have a possible dose response relationship, and then most prominent only with 30 mg, was somnolence (placebo, 7.7%; 15 mg, 8.7%; 20 mg, 7.5%; 30 mg, 15.3%).\nExtrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS): In the short-term, placebo-controlled trials of schizophrenia, the incidence of reported EPS for aripiprazole-treated patients was 6% versus 6% for placebo. In the short-term, placebo-controlled trials in bipolar mania, the incidence of reported EPS-related events excluding events related to akathisia for aripiprazole-treated patients was 17% versus 12% for placebo. In the short-term, placebo-controlled trials in bipolar mania, the incidence of akathisia-related events for aripiprazole-treated patients was 15% versus 4% for placebo. Objectively collected data from those trials was collected on the Simpson Angus Rating Scale (for EPS), the Barnes Akathisia Scale (for akathisia), and the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales (for dyskinesias). In the schizophrenia trials, the objectively collected data did not show a difference between aripiprazole and placebo, with the exception of the Barnes Akathisia Scale (aripiprazole, 0.08; placebo, -0.05). In the bipolar mania trials, the Simpson Angus Rating Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale showed a significant difference between aripiprazole and placebo (aripiprazole, 0.61; placebo, 0.03 and aripiprazole, 0.25; placebo, -0.06). Changes in the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales were similar for the aripiprazole and placebo groups.\nSimilarly, in a long-term (26-week), placebo-controlled trial of schizophrenia, objectively collected data on the Simpson Angus Rating Scale (for EPS), the Barnes Akathisia Scale (for akathisia), and the Assessments of Involuntary Movement Scales (for dyskinesias) did not show a difference between aripiprazole and placebo.\nLaboratory Test Abnormalities: A between group comparison for 3- to 6-week placebo-controlled trials revealed no medically important differences between the aripiprazole and placebo groups in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine serum chemistry, hematology or urinalysis parameters. Similarly, there were no aripiprazole/placebo differences in the incidence of discontinuations for changes in serum chemistry, hematology or urinalysis.\nIn a long-term (26-week), placebo-controlled trial, there were no medically important differences between the aripiprazole and placebo patients in the mean change from baseline in prolactin, fasting glucose, triglyceride, HDL, LDL and total cholesterol measurements.\nWeight Gain: In 4- to 6- week trials in schizophrenia, there was a slight difference in mean weight gain between aripiprazole and placebo patients (+0.7 kg vs -0.05 kg, respectively), and also a difference in the proportion of patients meeting a weight gain criterion of =7% of body weight [aripiprazole (8%) compared to placebo (3%)]. In 3-week trials in mania, the mean weight gain for aripiprazole and placebo patients was 0 kg versus -0.2 kg, respectively. The proportion of patients meeting a weight gain criterion of =7% of body weight was aripiprazole (3%) compared to placebo (2%).\nTable 3 provides the weight change results from a long-term (26-week), placebo-controlled study of aripiprazole, both mean change from baseline and proportions of patients meeting a weight gain criterion of =7% of body weight relative to baseline, categorized by body mass index (BMI) at baseline (see Table 3).\nTable 4 provides the weight change results from a long-term (52-week) study of aripiprazole, both mean change from baseline and proportions of patients meeting a weight gain criterion of =7% of body weight relative to baseline, categorized by BMI at baseline (see Table 4).\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) Changes: Between group comparisons for a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar mania revealed no significant differences between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportion of patients experiencing potentially important changes in ECG parameters. Aripiprazole was associated with a median increase in heart rate of 5 bpm compared to a 1 bpm increase among placebo patients.\nAdditional Findings Observed in Clinical Trials: Adverse Events in a Long-Term, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial: The adverse events reported in a 26-week, double-blind trial comparing Abilify and placebo in patients with schizophrenia were generally consistent with those reported in the short-term, placebo-controlled trials, except for a higher incidence of tremor [9% (13/153) for Abilify vs 1% (2/153) for placebo]. In this study, the majority of the cases of tremor were of mild intensity (9/13 mild and 4/13 moderate), occurred early in therapy (9/13 =49 days) and were of limited duration (9/13 =10 days). Tremor infrequently led to discontinuation (<1%) of Abilify. In addition, in a long-term (52-week), active-controlled study, the incidence of tremor for Abilify was 4% (34/859). A similar adverse event profile was observed in a long-term study in bipolar disorder.\nOther Adverse Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Aripiprazole: Following is a list of modified COSTART terms that reflect treatment-emergent adverse events as defined in the introduction to this section reported by patients treated with aripiprazole at multiple doses =2 mg/day during any phase of a trial within the database of 7951 patients. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 2 or other parts of this section, those considered in the Warnings or Precautions, those event terms which were so general as to be uninformative, events reported with an incidence of =0.05% and which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life-threatening, events that are otherwise common as background events, and events considered unlikely to be drug-related. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported occurred during treatment with aripiprazole, they were not necessarily caused by it.\nEvents are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: Frequent adverse events are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled trials appear in this listing); infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.\nBody as a Whole: Frequent: Flu syndrome, fever, chest pain, rigidity (including neck and extremity), neck pain, pelvic pain.

      "interactions": "Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when Abilify is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol. Due to its a1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.\nPotential for Other Drugs to Affect Abilify: Aripiprazole is not a substrate of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP2E1 enzymes. Aripiprazole also does not undergo direct glucuronidation. This suggests that an interaction of aripiprazole with inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes, or other factors eg, smoking is unlikely.\nBoth CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for aripiprazole metabolism. Agents that induce CYP3A4 (eg, carbamazepine) could cause an increase in aripiprazole clearance and lower blood levels. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole) or CYP2D6 (eg, quinidine, fluoxetine or paroxetine) can inhibit aripiprazole elimination and cause increased blood levels.\nKetoconazole: Co-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15-mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole occurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to ½ of its normal dose. Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (itraconazole) would be expected to have similar effects and need similar dose reductions; weaker inhibitors (erythromycin, grapefruit juice) have not been studied. When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased.\nQuinidine: Co-administration of a 10-mg single dose of aripiprazole with quinidine (166 mg/day for 13 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 112% but decreased the AUC of its active metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, by 35%. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to ½ of its normal dose when concomitant administration of quinidine with aripiprazole occurs. Other significant inhibitors of CYP2D6 eg, fluoxetine or paroxetine, would be expected to have similar effects and, therefore, should be accompanied by similar dose reductions. When the CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased.\nCarbamazapine: Co-administration of carbamazapine (200 mg 2 times a day), a potent CYP3A4 inducer, with aripiprazole (30 mg 4 times a day) resulted in an approximate 70% decrease in Cmax and AUC values of both aripiprazole and its active metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole. When carbamazapine is added to aripiprazole therapy, aripiprazole dose should be doubled. Additional dose increases should be based on clinical evaluation. When carbamazapine is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole should then be reduced.\nNo clinically significant effect of famotidine, valproate, or lithium was seen on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions).\nPotential for Abilify to Affect Other Drugs: Aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs metabolized by cytochrome P-450 enzymes. In in vivo studies, 10- to 30-mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on metabolism by CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole, warfarin) and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan) substrates. Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions).\nAlcohol: There was no significant difference between aripiprazole co-administered with ethanol and placebo co-administered with ethanol on performance of gross motor skills or stimulus response in healthy subjects. As with most psychoactive medications, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking Abilify.",

      "description": "It also contain the following inactive ingredients: Cornstarch, hydroxypropyl cellulose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. Colorants include ferric oxide (yellow or red).\nAripiprazole is 7-[4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butoxy]-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril. The empirical formula is C23H27Cl2N3O2 and its molecular weight is 448.39.",
      "mechanism": " Pharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors (Ki values of 0.34, 0.8, 1.7 and 3.4 nM, respectively), moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, a1-adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors (Ki values of 44, 15, 39, 57 and 61 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for the serotonin re-uptake site (Ki=98 nM). Aripiprazole has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic-muscarinic receptors (IC50 >1000 nM). Aripiprazole functions as a partial agonist at the dopamine D2 and the serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, and as an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.\nThe mechanism of action of aripiprazole, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is unknown. However, it has been proposed that the efficacy of aripiprazole is mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at D2 and 5-HT1A receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors. Actions at receptors other than D2, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole eg, the orthostatic hypotension observed with aripiprazole may be explained by its antagonist activity at adrenergic a1-receptors.\nPharmacokinetics: Abilify activity is presumably primarily due to the parent drug, aripiprazole, and to a lesser extent, to its major metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, which has been shown to have affinities for D2 receptors similar to the parent drug and represents 40% of the parent drug exposure in plasma. The mean elimination half-lives are about 75 and 94 hrs for aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, respectively. Steady-state concentrations are attained within 14 days of dosing for both active moieties. Aripiprazole accumulation is predictable from single-dose pharmacokinetics. At steady state, the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole is dose-proportional. Elimination of aripiprazole is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P-450 isozymes, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.\nAbsorption: Aripiprazole is well absorbed after administration of the tablet, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hrs; the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%. Abilify can be administered with or without food. Administration of a 15-mg tablet with a standard high-fat meal did not significantly affect the Cmax or AUC of aripiprazole or its active metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, but delayed Tmax by 3 hrs for aripiprazole and 12 hrs for dehydro-aripiprazole.\nDistribution: The steady-state volume of distribution of aripiprazole following IV administration is high (404 L or 4.9 L/kg), indicating extensive extravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and its major metabolite are >99% bound to serum proteins, primarily to albumin. In healthy human volunteers administered with aripiprazole 0.5-30 mg/day for 14 days, there was dose-dependent D2-receptor occupancy indicating brain penetration of aripiprazole in humans.\nMetabolism and Elimination: Aripiprazole is metabolized primarily by 3 biotransformation pathways: Dehydrogenation, hydroxylation and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant drug moiety in the systemic circulation. At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma.\nApproximately 8% of Caucasians lack the capacity to metabolize CYP2D6 substrates and are classified as poor metabolizers (PM), whereas the rest are extensive metabolizers (EM). PMs have about an 80% increase in aripiprazole exposure and about a 30% decrease in exposure to the active metabolite compared to EMs, resulting in about a 60% higher exposure to the total active moieties from a given dose of aripiprazole compared to EMs. Co-administration of Abilify with known inhibitors of CYP2D6 eg, quinidine in EMs, results in a 112% increase in aripiprazole plasma exposure, and dosing adjustment is needed (see Interactions). The mean elimination half-lives are about 75 and 146 hrs for aripiprazole in EMs and PMs, respectively. Aripiprazole does not inhibit or induce the CYP2D6 pathway.\nFollowing a single oral dose of [14C]-labeled aripiprazole, approximately 25% and 55% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% of the oral dose was recovered unchanged in the feces.\nSpecial Populations: In general, no dosage adjustment for Abilify is required on the basis of a patient's age, gender, race, smoking status, hepatic function, or renal function (see Dosage and Administration). The pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole in special populations are described as follows.\nHepatic Impairment (HI): In a single-dose study (aripiprazole 15 mg) in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B and C), the AUC of aripiprazole, compared to healthy subjects, increased 31% in mild HI, increased 8% in moderate HI, and decreased 20% in severe HI. None of these differences would require dose adjustment.\nRenal Impairment: In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), Cmax of aripiprazole (given in a single dose of 15 mg) and dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 36% and 53%, respectively, but AUC was 15% lower for aripiprazole and 7% higher for dehydro-aripiprazole. Renal excretion of both unchanged aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole is <1% of the dose. No dosage adjustment is required in subjects with renal impairment.\nElderly: In formal single-dose pharmacokinetic studies (with aripiprazole given in a single dose of 15 mg), aripiprazole clearance was 20% lower in elderly (=65 years) subjects compared to younger adult subjects (18-64 years). However, there was no detectable age effect in the population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenia patients. Also, the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole after multiple doses in elderly patients appeared similar to that observed in young healthy subjects. No dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients (see Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis under Warnings and Use in the elderly under Precautions).\nGender: Cmax and AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, are 30-40% higher in women than in men, and correspondingly, the apparent oral clearance of aripiprazole is lower in women. These differences, however, are largely explained by differences in body weight (25%) between men and women. No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender.\nRace: Although no specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race on the disposition of aripiprazole, population pharmacokinetic evaluation revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. No dosage adjustment is recommended based on race.\nSmoking: Based on studies utilizing human liver enzymes in vitro, aripiprazole is not a substrate for CYP1A2 and also does not undergo direct glucuronidation. Smoking should, therefore, not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. Consistent with these in vitro results, population pharmacokinetic evaluation did not reveal any significant pharmacokinetic differences between smokers and nonsmokers. No dosage adjustment is recommended based on smoking status.\nDrug-Drug Interactions: Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Abilify: Aripiprazole is not a substrate of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP2E1 enzymes. It also does not undergo direct glucuronidation. This suggests that an interaction of aripiprazole with inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes or other factors eg, smoking, is unlikely.\nBoth CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for aripiprazole metabolism. Agents that induce CYP3A4 (eg, carbamazepine) could cause an increase in aripiprazole clearance and lower blood levels. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole) or CYP2D6 (eg, quinidine, fluoxetine or paroxetine) can inhibit aripiprazole elimination and cause increased blood levels.\nPotential for Abilify to Affect Other Drugs: Aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs metabolized by cytochrome P-450 enzymes. In in vivo studies, 10- to 30-mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on metabolism by CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole, warfarin) and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan) substrates. Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro (see Precautions).\nAripiprazole had no clinically important interactions with the following drugs: Famotidine: Co-administration of aripiprazole (given in a single dose of 15 mg) with a 40-mg single dose of the H2-antagonist famotidine, a potent gastric acid blocker, decreased the solubility of aripiprazole and, hence, its rate of absorption, reducing by 37% and 21% the Cmax of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, respectively, and by 13% and 15%, respectively, the extent of absorption (AUC). No dosage adjustment of aripiprazole is required when administered concomitantly with famotidine.\nValproate: When valproate (500-1500 mg/day) and aripiprazole (30 mg/day) were co-administered at steady state, the Cmax and AUC of aripiprazole were decreased by 25%. No dosage adjustment of aripiprazole is required when administered concomitantly with valproate.\nLithium: A pharmacokinetic interaction of aripiprazole with lithium is unlikely because lithium is not bound to plasma proteins, is not metabolized, and almost entirely excreted unchanged in urine. Co-administration of therapeutic doses of lithium (1200-1800 mg/day) for 21 days with aripiprazole (30 mg/day) did not result in clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole or its active metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole (Cmax and AUC increased by <20%). No dosage adjustment of aripiprazole is required when administered concomitantly with lithium.\nDextromethorphan: Aripiprazole at doses of 10-30 mg/day for 14 days had no effect on dextromethorphan's O-dealkylation to its major metabolite, dextrorphan, a pathway known to be dependent on CYP2D6 activity. Aripiprazole also had no effect on dextromethorphan's N-demethylation to its metabolite 3-methyoxymorphan, a pathway known to be dependent on CYP3A4 activity. No dosage adjustment of dextromethorphan is required when administered concomitantly with aripiprazole.\nWarfarin: Aripiprazole 10 mg/day for 14 days had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of R- and S-warfarin or on the pharmacodynamic endpoint of international normalized ratio, indicating the lack of a clinically relevant effect of aripiprazole on CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 metabolism or the binding of a highly protein-bound warfarin. No dosage adjustment of warfarin is required when administered concomitantly with aripiprazole.\nOmeprazole: Aripiprazole 10 mg/day for 15 days had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single 20-mg dose of omeprazole, a CYP2C19 substrate, in healthy subjects. No dosage adjustment of omeprazole is required when administered concomitantly with aripiprazole.\nClinical Studies: Schizophrenia: The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia was evaluated in 4 short-term (4- and 6-week), placebo-controlled trials of acutely relapsed inpatients who predominantly met DSM-III/IV criteria for schizophrenia. Three of the 4 trials were able to distinguish aripiprazole from placebo, but one study, the smallest, did not. Three of these studies also included an active control group consisting of either risperidone (1 trial) or haloperidol (2 trials), but they were not designed to allow for a comparison of Abilify and the active comparators.\nIn the 3 positive trials for Abilify, 4 primary measures were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is a multi-item inventory of general psychopathology used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in schizophrenia. The PANSS positive subscale is a subset of items in the PANSS that rates 7 positive symptoms of schizophrenia (delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility). The PANSS negative subscale is a subset of items in the PANSS that rates 7 negative symptoms of schizophrenia (blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive apathetic withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity/flow of conversation, stereotyped thinking). The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) assessment reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient.\nIn a 4-week trial (n=414) comparing 2 fixed doses of Abilify (15 or 30 mg/day) and haloperidol (10 mg/day) to placebo, both doses of Abilify were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score, PANSS positive subscale, and CGI-severity score. In addition, the 15-mg dose was superior to placebo in the PANSS negative subscale.\nIn a 4-week trial (n=404) comparing 2 fixed doses of Abilify (20 or 30 mg/day) and risperidone (6 mg/day) to placebo, both doses of Abilify were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score, PANSS positive subscale PANSS negative subscale and CGI-severity score.\nIn a 6-week trial (n=420) comparing 3 fixed doses of Abilify (10, 15 or 20 mg/day) to placebo, all 3 doses of Abilify were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score, PANSS positive subscale, and the PANSS negative subscale.\nIn a 4th study, a 4-week trial (n=103) comparing Abilify in a range of 5-30 mg/day or haloperidol 5-20 mg/day to placebo, haloperidol was superior to placebo, in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (Blood PressureRS), a multi-item inventory of general psychopathology traditionally used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in psychosis, and in a responder analysis based on the CGI-severity score, the primary outcomes for that trial. Abilify was only significantly different compared to placebo in a responder analysis based on the CGI-severity score.\nThus, the efficacy of 15, 20 and 30-mg daily doses was established in 2 studies for each dose, whereas the efficacy of the 10-mg dose was established in 1 study. There was no evidence in any study that the higher dose groups offered any advantage over the lowest dose group.\nAn examination of population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential responsiveness on the basis of age, gender or race.\nA longer-term trial enrolled 310 inpatients or outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia who were, by history, symptomatically stable on other antipsychotic medications for periods of 3 months or longer. These patients were discontinued from their antipsychotic medications and randomized to Abilify 15 mg or placebo for up to 26 weeks of observation for relapse. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as CGI-Improvement score of =5 (minimally worse), scores =5 (moderately severe) on the hostility or uncooperativeness items of the PANSS, or =20% increase in the PANSS total score. Patients receiving Abilify 15 mg experienced a significantly longer time to relapse over the subsequent 26 weeks compared to those receiving placebo.\nBipolar Disorder: The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of acute manic episodes was established in two 3-week, placebo-controlled trials in hospitalized patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes (in one trial, 21% of placebo and 42% of Abilify-treated patients had data beyond 2 weeks). These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course.\nThe primary instrument used for assessing manic symptoms was the Young Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS), an 11-item clinician-rated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of manic symptomatology (irritability, disruptive/aggressive behavior, sleep, elevated mood, speech, increased activity, sexual interest, language/thought disorder, thought content, appearance and insight) in a range from 0 (no manic features) to 60 (maximum score). A key secondary instrument included the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar (CGI-Blood Pressure) scale.\nIn the 2 positive 3-week, placebo-controlled trials (n=268; n=248) which evaluated Abilify 15 or 30 mg/day once daily (with a starting dose of 30 mg/day), Abilify was superior to placebo in the reduction of Y-MRS total score and CGI-Blood Pressure severity of illness score (mania).\nA trial was conducted in patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder with a recent manic or mixed episode who had been stabilized on open-label Abilify and who had maintained a clinical response for at least 6 weeks. The 1st phase of this trial was an open-label stabilization period in which inpatients and outpatients were clinically stabilized and then maintained on open-label Abilify (15 or 30 mg/day, with a starting dose of 30 mg/day) for at least 6 consecutive weeks. One hundred sixty-one (161) outpatients were then randomized in a double-blind fashion, to either the same dose of Abilify they were on at the end of the stabilization and maintenance period or placebo and were then monitored for manic or depressive relapse. During the randomization phase, Abilify was superior to placebo on time to the number of combined affective relapses (manic plus depressive), the primary outcome measure for this study. The majority of these relapses were due to manic rather than depressive symptoms. There is insufficient data to know whether Abilify is effective in delaying the time to occurrence of depression in patients with bipolar I disorder.\nAn examination of the population subgroups did not reveal any clear evidence of differential responsiveness on the basis of age and gender; however, there were insufficient numbers of patients in each of the ethnic groups to adequately assess intergroup differences.\nAripiprazole produced retinal degeneration in albino rats in a 26-week chronic toxicity study at a dose of 60 mg/kg and in a 2-year carcinogenicity study at doses of 40 and 60 mg/kg. The 40- and 60-mg/kg doses are 13 and 19 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on mg/m2 and 7-14 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC. Evaluation of the retinas of albino mice and monkeys did not reveal evidence of retinal degeneration. Additional studies to further evaluate the mechanism have not been performed. The relevance of this finding to human risk is unknown.",

      "special-precautions": "ACCOLATE should be taken regularly to achieve benefit, even during symptom free periods.\nACCOLATE therapy should normally be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma.\nACCOLATE does not allow a reduction in existing steroid treatment.\nAs with inhaled steroids and cromones (disodium cromoglycate, nedocromil sodium), ACCOLATE is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks.\nACCOLATE has not been evaluated in the treatment of labile (brittle) or unstable asthma.\nRarely, patients with asthma on anti-leukotriene medications, including ACCOLATE, may present with systemic eosinophilia, eosinophilic pneumonia or with clinical features of systemic vasculitis, consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome. Presentations may involve various body systems including vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications or neuropathy. These events have usually, but not always, been associated with reductions and/or withdrawal of steroid therapy. The possibility that leukotriene-receptor antagonists, including ACCOLATE may be associated with emergence of Churg-Strauss syndrome can neither be excluded nor established. If a patient develops an eosinophilic condition or a Churg-Strauss syndrome-type illness, ACCOLATE should be stopped, a rechallenge test should not be performed and treatment should not be restarted.\nElevations in serum transaminases can occur during treatment with ACCOLATE. These are usually asymptomatic and transient but could represent early evidence of hepatotoxicity, and have been very rarely associated with more severe hepatocellular injury, fulminant hepatitis and liver failure, some of which resulted in a fatal outcome. Extremely rarely, case of fulminant hepatitis and liver failure has been reported in patient in whom no previous clinical sign or symptoms of liver dysfunction were reported.\nIf clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of liver dysfunction occur (e.g. anorexia, nausea, vomiting, upper right quadrant pain, fatigue, lethargy, flu-like symptoms, enlarged liver, pruritus and jaundice), ACCOLATE should be discontinued. The serum transaminases, in particular serum ALT, should be measured immediately and the patient managed accordingly.\nPhysicians may consider the value of routine liver function testing. Periodic serum transaminase testing has not been proven to prevent serious injury but is generally believed that early detection of drug-induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect drug may enhance the likelihood of recovery. If liver function testing shows evidence of hepatotoxicity, ACCOLATE should be discontinued immediately and the patient managed accordingly.\nPatients in whom ACCOLATE was withdrawn because of hepatotoxicity cause should not be re-exposed to ACCOLATE.\nEffects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines: There is no evidence that ACCOLATE affects the ability to drive and use machinery.\nUse In Pregnancy and Lactation The safety of ACCOLATE in human pregnancy has not been established. In animal studies, zafirlukast did not have any apparent effect on fertility and did not appear to have any teratogenic or selective toxic effect on the foetus. The potential risks should be weighed against the benefits of continuing therapy during pregnancy and ACCOLATE should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\nZafirlukast is excreted in human breast milk. ACCOLATE should not be administered to mothers who are breast-feeding.",
      "adverse-reactions": "Adverse reactions, which have been associated with ACCOLATE treatment, are given in the table (see table).\nHepatic Effects: Elevated serum transaminase levels have been observed in clinical trials with ACCOLATE. The changes usually resolved during continued treatment or following cessation of therapy. Rarely the transaminase profile has been consistent with a drug-induced hepatitis, which resolved following cessation of ACCOLATE therapy.\nHyperbilirubinemia without elevated liver function tests has also been associated with the use of ACCOLATE.\nDuring post-marketing experience there have been rare reports of symptomatic hepatitis, with and without hyperbilirubinemia, associated with the use of ACCOLATE. These cases have usually resolved following cessation of therapy with ACCOLATE. The predominate majority of cases have been reported in females. Very rarely, fulminant hepatitis and hepatic failure have been reported, sometimes with a fatal outcome (see Precautions).\nInfection: In placebo-controlled clinical trials, an increased incidence of infection has been observed in elderly patients given ACCOLATE. Infections were usually mild, predominantly affecting the respiratory tract.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "ACCOLATE may be administered with other therapies routinely used in the management of asthma and allergy. Inhaled steroids, inhaled and oral bronchodilator therapy, antibiotics and antihistamines are examples of agents which have been co-administered with ACCOLATE without adverse interaction.\nACCOLATE may be administered with oral contraceptives without adverse interaction.\nCo-administration with warfarin results in an increase in maximum prothrombin time by approximately 35%. It is therefore recommended that if ACCOLATE is co-administered with warfarin, prothrombin time should be closely monitored. The interaction is probably due to an inhibition by zafirlukast of the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme system.\nIn clinical trials, co-administration with theophylline resulted in decreased plasma levels of zafirlukast, by approximately 30%, but with no effect on plasma theophylline levels. However, during post-marketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of patients experiencing increased theophylline levels when co-administered ACCOLATE.\nCo-administration with terfenadine resulted in a 54% decrease in AUC for zafirlukast, but with no effect on plasma terfenadine levels.\nCo-administration with acetylsalicylic acid (\"aspirin\", 650 mg four times a day) may result in increased plasma levels of zafirlukast, by approximately 45%.\nCo-administration with erythromycin will result in decreased plasma levels of zafirlukast, by approximately 40%.\nCo-administration with fluconazole, a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor, resulted in increased plasma levels of zafirlukast, by approximately 60%. The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown.\nCo-administration with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, caused no change in plasma levels of zafirlukast.\nThe clearance of zafirlukast in smokers may be increased by approximately 20%.\nAt concentrations of 10 microgram/ml and above, zafirlukast causes increases in the assay value for bilirubin in animal plasma. However, zafirlukast has not been shown to interfere with the 2,5-dichlorophenyl diazonium salt method of bilirubin analysis of human plasma.",

      "mechanism": "Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Leukotriene-receptor antagonist. ATC Code: R03D C01.\nPharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4) are potent inflammatory eicosanoids released from various cells including mast cells and eosinophils. These important pro-asthmatic mediators bind to cysteinyl leukotriene receptors found in the human airway.\nLeukotriene production and receptor occupation have been implicated in the pathophysiology of asthma. Effects include smooth muscle contraction, airway oedema and altered cell activity associated with the inflammatory process, including eosinophil influx to the lung.\nAccolate is a competitive, highly selective and potent oral peptide leukotriene antagonist of LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4 components of slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis. In vitro studies have shown that ACCOLATE antagonises the contractile activity of all three peptide leukotrienes (leukotriene C4, D4 and E4) in human conducting airway smooth muscle to the same extent. Animal studies have shown ACCOLATE to be effective in preventing peptide leukotriene-induced increases in vascular permeability, which give rise to oedema in the airways and to inhibit peptide leukotriene-induced influx of eosinophils into airways.\nThe specificity of ACCOLATE has been shown by its action on leukotriene receptors and not on prostaglandin, thromboxane, cholinergic and histamine receptors.\nIn a placebo-controlled study where segmental bronchoprovocation with allergen was followed by bronchoalveolar lavage 48 hours later, zafirlukast decreased the rise in basophils, lymphocytes and histamine, and reduced the stimulated production of superoxide by alveolar macrophages.\nACCOLATE attenuated the increase in bronchial hyper-responsiveness that follows inhaled allergen challenge. Further, methacholine sensitivity was diminished by long-term dosing with ACCOLATE 20 mg twice daily.\nFurther, in clinical trials evaluating chronic therapy with ACCOLATE, the lung function measured when plasma levels were at trough showed sustained improvements over baseline.\nACCOLATE shows a dose-dependent inhibition of bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled LTD4. Asthmatic patients are approximately 10-fold more sensitive to the bronchoconstricting activity of inhaled LTD4. A single oral dose of ACCOLATE can enable an asthmatic patient to inhale 100 times more LTD4 and shows significant protection at 12 and 24 hours.\nACCOLATE inhibits the bronchoconstriction caused by several kinds of challenge, such as the response to sulphur dioxide, exercise and cold air. ACCOLATE attenuates the early and late phase inflammatory reaction caused by various antigens such as grass, cat dander, ragweed and mixed antigens.\nIn asthmatic patients not adequately controlled by beta-agonist therapy (given as required), ACCOLATE improves symptoms (reducing daytime and nocturnal asthmatic symptoms), improves lung function, reduces the need for concomitant beta-agonist medication and reduces incidence of exacerbations. Similar benefits have been seen in patients with more severe asthma receiving high-dose inhaled steroids.\nIn clinical studies, there was a significant first-dose effect on baseline bronchomotor tone observed within 2 hours of dosing, when peak plasma concentrations had not yet been achieved. Initial improvements in asthma symptoms occurred within the first week and often the first few days, of treatment with ACCOLATE.\nPharmacokinetics: Peak plasma concentrations of zafirlukast are achieved approximately 3 hours after oral administration of ACCOLATE.\nAdministration of ACCOLATE with food increased the variability in the bioavailability of zafirlukast and reduced bioavailability in most (75%) subjects. The net reduction was approximately 40%.\nFollowing twice-daily administration of ACCOLATE (30 to 80 mg bd), accumulation of zafirlukast in plasma was low (not detectable: 2.9 times first dose values; mean 1.45; median 1.27). The terminal half-life of zafirlukast is approximately 10 hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations of zafirlukast were proportional to the dose and predictable from single-dose pharmacokinetic data.\nZafirlukast is extensively metabolised. Following a radiolabelled dose, the urinary excretion accounts for approximately 10% dose and faecal excretion for 89%. Zafirlukast is not detected in urine. The metabolites identified in human plasma were found to be at least 90-fold less potent than zafirlukast in a standard in vitro test of activity.\nZafirlukast is approximately 99% protein bound to human plasma proteins, predominantly albumin, over the concentration range of 0.25 to 4.0 microgram/ml.\nPharmacokinetic studies in special populations have been performed in a relatively small number of subjects, and the clinical significance of the following kinetic data is not established.\nPharmacokinetics of zafirlukast in adolescents and adults with asthma were similar to those of healthy adult males. When adjusted for body weight, the pharmacokinetics of zafirlukast are not significantly different between men and women.\nElderly subjects and subjects with stable alcoholic cirrhosis demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in Cmax and AUC compared to normal subjects given the same doses of ACCOLATE.\nThere are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of zafirlukast in patients with mild renal impairment and in normal subjects. However, there are no conclusive data available in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, hence, the recommendation for caution is used in this patient population.\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: After multiple doses of greater than 40 mg/kg/day for up to 12 months, liver enlargement associated with degenerative/fatty change or glycogen deposition was seen in rats, mice and dogs. Histiocytic aggregates were seen in a number of tissues of dogs.\nMale mice given zafirlukast 300 mg/kg daily had an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas compared to control animals. Rats given 2,000 mg/kg zafirlukast daily had an increased incidence of urinary bladder papilloma compared to control animals. Zafirlukast was not mutagenic in a range of tests. The clinical significance of these findings during the long term use of ACCOLATE in man is uncertain.\nThere were no other notable findings from the preclinical testing.",

      "special-precautions": "Recommended dosage should not be exceeded.\nNot recommended for children <2 years, pregnancy, lactation except by physician's advise. Discontinue therapy when insomnia, palpitation or dizziness occur.\nAlthough there are no objective data, users of Actifed should avoid the concomitant use of alcohol or other centrally-acting sedatives.\nAlthough pseudoephedrine has virtually no pressor effects in normotensive patients, Actifed should be used with caution in patients taking antihypertensive agents, tricyclic antidepressants or other sympathomimetic agents eg, decongestants, appetite suppressants and amphetamine-like psychostimulants. The effects of a single dose on the blood pressure of these patients should be observed before recommending repeated or unsupervised treatment.\nAs with other sympathomimetic agents, Actifed should be used with caution in patients with hypertension, heart diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, elevated intraocular pressure and prostatic enlargement.\nThere have been no specific studies of Actifed in patients with hepatic and/or renal dysfunction. Caution should be exercised in the presence of severe renal or hepatic impairment.\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: Actifed may cause drowsiness and impair performance in tests of auditory vigilance. Patients should not drive or operate machinery until they have determined their own response.\nCarcinogenicity, Mutagenicity and Impairment of Fertility: There is insufficient information available to determine whether triprolidine and pseudoephedrine have mutagenic or carcinogenic potential.\nNo studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether triprolidine or pseudoephedrine have the potential to impair fertility. Systemic administration of pseudoephedrine in rats up to 7 times the human daily dosage in females and 35 times the human daily dosage in males did not impair fertility nor alter foetal morphological development and survival. There is no information on the effect of Actifed on human fertility.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: Although pseudoephedrine and triprolidine have been in widespread use for many years, there are no specific data on their use during pregnancy. Caution should therefore be exercised by balancing the potential benefit of treatment against any possible hazards to the developing foetus.\nPseudoephedrine and triprolidine are excreted in breast milk in small amounts but the effect of this on breastfed infants is not known. It has been estimated that 0.5-0.7% of a single dose of pseudoephedrine ingested by a mother will be excreted in the breast milk over 24 hrs.\nBecause of the higher than usual risks from antihistamines and sympathomimetic amines for infants generally and for newborn and premature infants in particular, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue Actifed.\nUse in the elderly: There have been no specific studies of Actifed in the elderly. Experience has indicated that normal adult dosage is appropriate, although it may be advisable to monitor renal and/or hepatic function; if there is serious impairment, then caution should be exercised.",

      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Triprolidine provides symptomatic relief in conditions believed to depend wholly or partly upon the triggered release of histamine. It is a competitive histamine H1-receptor antagonist of the pyrrolidine class with mild central nervous system depressant properties which may cause drowsiness.\nPseudoephedrine has direct and indirect sympathomimetic activity and is an upper respiratory decongestant. Pseudoephedrine is substantially less potent than ephedrine in producing both tachycardia and elevation in systolic blood pressure and considerably less potent in causing stimulation of the central nervous system.\nPharmacokinetics: After the administration of Actifed to healthy adult volunteers, the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of triprolidine is approximately 5.5-6 ng/mL, occurring at about 2 hrs (Tmax) for the tablet and 1.5 hrs for the syrup.\nThe plasma half-life of triprolidine is approximately 3.2 hrs. The Cmax of pseudoephedrine is approximately 180 ng/mL for both the tablet and syrup with Tmax approximately 2 hrs for the tablet and 1.5 hrs for the syrup after drug administration. The plasma half-life of pseudoephedrine is approximately 5.5 hrs (urine pH maintained between 5-7). The plasma half-life of pseudoephedrine is markedly decreased by acidification of urine and increased by alkalinisation.\nAfter oral administration of a single dose of 2.5 mg triprolidine to adults, the onset of action, as determined by the ability to antagonise histamine-induced wheals and flares in the skin, is within 1-2 hrs. Peak effects occur at about 3 hrs and although activity declines thereafter, significant inhibition of histamine-induced wheals and flares still occurs 8 hrs after dosing.\nPseudoephedrine produces its decongestant effect within 30 min, which persists for at least 4 hrs.\nPseudoephedrine is partly metabolised in the liver by N-demethylation to norpseudoephedrine, an active metabolite. Pseudoephedrine and its metabolite are excreted in the urine; 55-75% of a dose is excreted unchanged. The rate of urinary excretion of pseudoephedrine is accelerated when the urine is acidified. Conversely, as the urine pH increases, the rate of urinary excretion is slowed.\nAnimal hepatic microsomal enzyme studies have revealed the presence of several triprolidine metabolites with an oxidised product of the toluene methyl group predominating. In man, it has been reported that only about 1% of an administered dose is eliminated as unchanged triprolidine over a 24-hr period.\nTeratogenicity: In rats and rabbits, systemic administration of triprolidine up to 75 times the human daily dosage did not produce teratogenic effects. Systemic administration of pseudoephedrine, up to 50 times the human daily dosage in rats and up to 35 times the human daily dosage in rabbits, did not produce teratogenic effects.",

Actilyse has proven to reduce 30-day-mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction.\nThrombolytic treatment in acute massive pulmonary embolism with haemodynamic instability: The diagnosis should be confirmed whenever possible by objective means eg, pulmonary angiography or noninvasive procedures eg, lung scanning. There are no clinical trials on mortality and late morbidity related to pulmonary embolism.\nThrombolytic treatment of acute ischaemic stroke: Treatment should only be initiated within 3 hrs after the onset of stroke symptoms and after exclusion of intracranial haemorrhage by appropriate imaging techniques eg, cranial computerised tomography (CT).",
      "dosage": "Actilyse should be given as soon as possible after symptom onset.\nMyocardial Infarction: 90-min (accelerated) dose regimen in whom treatment can be started within 6 hrs after symptom onset: 15 mg as an IV bolus, 50 mg as an infusion over the first 30 min, followed by an infusion of 35 mg over 60 min, until the maximal dose of 100 mg. In patients with a body weight <65 kg, the total dose should be weight-adjusted with 15 mg as an IV bolus and 0.75 mg/kg body weight over 30 min (maximum of 50 mg), followed by an infusion of 0.5 mg/kg over 60 min (maximum of 35 mg).\n3-hr dose regimen in whom treatment can be started between 6 and 12 hrs after symptom onset: 10 mg as an IV bolus, 50 mg as an IV infusion over the 1st hour, followed by infusions of 10 mg over 30 min, until the maximal dose of 100 mg over 3 hrs. In patients with a body weight <65 kg, the total dose should not exceed 1.5 mg/kg.\nThe accepted maximum dose in acute myocardial infarction is alteplase 100 mg.\nAdjunctive Therapy: Acetylsalicylic acid should be initiated as soon as possible after symptom onset and continued for the 1st month after myocardial infarction. The recommended dose is 160-300 mg/day.\nHeparin should be administered concomitantly for =24 hrs (at least 48 hrs with the accelerated dose regimen). It is recommended to start with an initial IV bolus of 5000 units prior to thrombolytic therapy and to continue with an infusion of 1000 units/hr. The dose of heparin should be adjusted according to repeated measurements of activated partial thromboplastin time values (aPTT) of 1.5- to 2.5-fold of the initial value.\nPulmonary Embolism: A total dose of 100 mg should be administered in 2 hrs. Most experience available is with the following dose regimen: 10 mg as an IV bolus over 1-2 min, 90 mg as an IV infusion over 2 hrs.\nThe total dose should not exceed 1.5 mg/kg in patients with a body weight <65 kg.\nAdjunctive Therapy: After treatment with Actilyse, heparin therapy should be initiated (or resumed) when aPTT values are less than twice the upper limit of normal. The infusion should be adjusted according to aPTT values of 1.5- to 2.5-fold of the initial value.\nAcute Ischaemic Stroke: Recommended Dose: 0.9 mg/kg (maximum of 90 mg) infused over 60 min with 10% of the total dose administered as an initial IV bolus. Therapy should be initiated as early as possible within 3 hrs after onset of symptoms.\nAdjunctive Therapy: The safety and efficacy of this regimen with concomitant administration of heparin and acetylsalicylic acid during the first 24 hrs after the symptom onset has not been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, administration of acetylsalicylic acid or IV heparin should be avoided in the first 24 hrs after treatment with Actilyse. If heparin is required for other indications (eg, prevention of deep vein thrombosis) the dose should not exceed 10,000 IU/day administered SC.\nAdministration: Instructions for Use/Handling: Under aseptic conditions, the contents of an injection vial of Actilyse (50 mg) dry substance is dissolved with water for injection (50 mL) to obtain a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. Thus, for reconstitution to the final concentration of alteplase 1 mg/mL, the full volume of solvent provided should be transferred to the vial containing Actilyse dry substance. For this purpose a transfer cannula is included with a pack size of 50 mg. The reconstituted solution should then be administered IV as described above. The reconstituted solution may be diluted further with sterile physiological saline solution (0.9%) up to a minimal concentration of 0.2 mg/mL.\nIt may not, however, be diluted with water for injections or carbohydrate infusion solutions eg, dextrose.\nActilyse must not be mixed with other drugs, neither in the same infusion-vial nor via the same venous line (not even with heparin).",
      "over-dosage": "The relative fibrin specificity not withstanding a clinically significant reduction in fibrinogen and other blood coagulation components may occur after overdosage. In most cases, it is sufficient to await the physiological regeneration of these factors after the Actilyse therapy has been terminated. If however, severe bleeding results, the infusion of fresh frozen plasma or fresh blood is recommended and if necessary, synthetic antifibrinolytics may be administered.",
      "contra-indications": "The following contraindications apply in general.\nAs with all thrombolytic agents, Actilyse should not be used in cases where there is a high risk of haemorrhage eg, significant bleeding disorder at present or within the past 6 months, known haemorrhagic diathesis; patients receiving oral anticoagulants eg, warfarin sodium (INR >1.3); any history of central nervous system damage (ie, neoplasm, aneurysm, intracranial or spinal surgery); history, evidence or suspicion of intracranial haemorrhage including sub-arachnoid haemorrhage; severe uncontrolled arterial hypertension; major surgery or significant trauma in the past 3 months (this includes any trauma associated with the current acute myocardial infarction), recent trauma of the head or cranium; prolonged or traumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (>2 min), obstetrical delivery within the past 10 days, recent puncture of a noncompressible blood vessel (eg, subclavian or jugular vein puncture); severe hepatic dysfunction, including hepatic failure, cirrhosis, portal hypertension (oesophageal varices) and active hepatitis; haemorrhagic retinopathy eg, in diabetes (vision disturbances may indicate haemorrhagic retinopathy) or other haemorrhagic ophthalmic conditions; bacterial endocarditis and pericarditis; acute pancreatitis; documented ulcerative gastrointestinal disease during the last 3 months; arterial aneurysms, arterial/venous malformations; neoplasm with increased bleeding risk; hypersensitivity to alteplase or to any of the excipients of Actilyse.\nThe following contraindications apply where Actilyse is indicated: Acute Myocardial Infarction and Pulmonary Embolism: History of stroke.\nAcute Ischaemic Stroke: Symptoms of ischaemic attack which began >3 hrs prior to infusion or when the onset of symptom is unknown; symptoms of acute ischaemic stroke which were either rapidly improving or only minor prior to start of infusion; severe stroke assessed clinically (eg, NIHSS >25) and/or by appropriate imaging techniques; seizure at the onset of stroke; history of previous stroke or serious head trauma within 3 months; combination of previous stroke and diabetes mellitus; administration of heparin within 48 hrs preceding the onset of stroke with an elevated aPTT at presentation; platelet count <100,000/mm3; systolic blood pressure >185 or diastolic blood pressure >110 mm Hg, or aggressive management (IV medication) necessary to reduce blood pressure to these limits; blood glucose <50 mg/dL or >400 mg/dL.\nActilyse is not indicated for the therapy of acute stroke in children and adolescents <18 years or adults >80 years.",
      "special-precautions": "Actilyse should be used by physicians experienced in the use of thrombolytic treatment and with facilities to monitor the use. As with other thrombolytics, it is recommended that when Actilyse is administered, standard resuscitation equipment and medication be available in all circumstances.\nGeneral: Bleeding: The most common complication encountered during Actilyse therapy is bleeding. The concomitant use of heparin anticoagulant may contribute to bleeding. As fibrin is lysed during Actilyse therapy, bleeding from recent puncture sites may occur. Therefore, thrombolytic therapy requires careful attention to all possible bleeding sites (including those following catheter insertion, arterial and venous puncture cut down and needle puncture). The use of rigid catheters, IM injections and non-essential handling of the patient should be avoided during treatment with Actilyse.\nShould serious bleeding occur, in particular cerebral haemorrhage, the fibrinolytic therapy must be discontinued and concomitant heparin administration should be terminated immediately. Administration of protamine should be considered if heparin has been administered within 4 hrs before the onset of bleeding. In the few patients who fail to respond to these conservative measures, judicious use of transfusion products may be indicated. Transfusion of cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma and platelets should be considered with clinical and laboratory re-assessment after each administration. A target fibrinogen level of 1 g/L is desirable with cryoprecipitate infusion. Antifibrinolytic agents should also be considered.\nA dose >100 mg of Actilyse should not be given in acute myocardial infarction as well as pulmonary embolism and 90 mg in acute ischaemic stroke because it has been associated with an increase in intracranial bleeding.\nNo sustained antibody formation to the recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator molecule has been observed after treatment. There is no systemic experience with re-administration of Actilyse. If an anaphylactoid reaction occurs, the infusion should be discontinued and appropriate treatment should be initiated. Monitoring is recommended particularly for patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors concomitantly (see Adverse Reactions). As with all thrombolytics, the use of Actilyse therapy has to be carefully evaluated in order to balance the potential risks of bleeding with expected benefits under the following conditions: Recent IM injection or small recent traumas eg, biopsies, puncture of major vessels, cardiac massage for resuscitation; conditions with an increased risk of haemorrhage which are not mentioned under Contraindications.\nFor the treatment of acute myocardial infarction and acute pulmonary embolism, caution should be exercised in patients with systolic blood pressure >160 mmHg; advanced age, which may increase the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage. As the therapeutic benefit is also increased in elderly patients, the risk-benefit evaluation should be carried out carefully.\nFor the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, the following precautions apply:\nArrhythmias: Coronary thrombolysis may result in arrhythmia associated with reperfusion.\nGlycoprotein IIb/IIIa Antagonists: There is no experience with the use of GP IIb/IIIa antagonists within the first 24 hrs after start of treatment.\nThromboembolism: The use of thrombolytics can increase the risk of thromboembolic events in patients with left heart thrombus eg, mitral stenosis or atrial fibrillation.\nFor the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke, the following precautions apply:\nTreatment must be performed only by a physician trained and experienced in neurological care. Compared to other indications, patients with acute ischaemic stroke treated with Actilyse have a markedly increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage as the bleeding occurs predominantly into the infarcted area. This applies in particular in the following cases: All situations listed in Contraindications and in all general situations involving a high risk of haemorrhage; small asymptomatic aneurysm of the cerebral vessels; patients pre-treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) may have a greater risk of intracerebral haemorrhage, particularly if Actilyse treatment is delayed. Not more than 0.9 mg alteplase/kg body weight (maximum of 90 mg) should be administered in view of the increased risk of cerebral haemorrhage.\nTreatment should not be initiated later than 3 hrs after the onset of symptoms because of unfavourable benefit/risk ratio mainly based on the following: Positive treatment effects decrease over time; particularly in patients with prior acetylsalicylic acid treatment the mortality rate increases; increased risk of symptomatic haemorrhage.\nBlood pressure (Blood Pressure) monitoring during treatment administration and up to 24 hrs is necessary; IV antihypertensive therapy is recommended if systolic Blood Pressure >180 mmHg or diastolic Blood Pressure >105 mmHg.\nThe therapeutic benefit is reduced in patients who have had a prior stroke or in whom uncontrolled diabetes exists. The benefit/risk ratio is considered less favourable, although still positive in these patients.\nIn patients with very mild stroke, the risks outweigh the expected benefit and they should not be treated with Actilyse.\nPatients with very severe stroke are at higher risk of intracerebral haemorrhage and death should not be treated with Actilyse.\nPatients with extensive infarctions are at greater risk of poor outcome including severe haemorrhage and death. In such patients, the benefit/risk ratio should be thoroughly considered.\nIn stroke patients, the likelihood of a favourable outcome decreases with increasing age, increasing stroke severity and increased levels of blood glucose on admission while the likelihood of severe disability and death or relevant intracranial bleeding increases, independently of treatment. Patients >80 years, patients with severe stroke (as assessed clinically and/or by appropriate imaging techniques) and patients with blood glucose levels <50 or >400 mg/dL at baseline should not be treated with Actilyse.\nReperfusion of the ischaemic area may induce cerebral edema in the infarcted zone. Due to an increased haemorrhagic risk, treatment with platelet aggregation inhibitors should not be initiated within the first 24 hrs following thrombolysis with alteplase.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: There is very limited experience with the use of Actilyse during pregnancy and lactation. In cases of an acute life-threatening disease, the benefit has to be evaluated against the potential risk.\nIt is not known if alteplase is excreted into the breast milk.\nUse in children: There is only limited experience with the use of Actilyse in children.\nUse in the elderly: The risk of intracerebral haemorrhage is increased in elderly patients. As the therapeutic benefit is also increased in elderly patients, the risk-benefit evaluation should be carried out carefully.",
      "adverse-reactions": "The following adverse events which may be causally related to the administration of Actilyse have been reported. The most frequent adverse reaction associated with Actilyse is bleeding resulting in a fall in haematocrit and/or haemoglobin values. The type of bleeding associated with thrombolytic therapy can be divided into 2 broad categories: Superficial or surface bleeding, normally from punctures or damaged blood vessels; and internal bleedings into the gastrointestinal or urogenital tract, retroperitoneum or CNS or bleeding of parenchymatous organs.\nDeath and permanent disability are reported in patients who have experienced stroke (including intracranial bleeding) and other serious bleeding episodes.\nThe frequencies given as follows are based on corresponding occurrences in a clinical trial involving 8299 patients treated with Actilyse for myocardial infarction.\nThe classification of cholesterol crystal embolisation which was not observed in the clinical trial population was based on spontaneous reporting.\nThe number of patients treated in clinical trials with pulmonary embolism and stroke (within the 0-3 hrs time window) is very small in comparison to the number in the trial for myocardial infarction described previously. Therefore, small numerical differences observed in comparison with the number in myocardial infarction were presumably attributable to the small sample size. Except for intracranial haemorrhage as an adverse reaction in stroke as well as for reperfusion arrhythmias in myocardial infarction, there is no medical reason to assume that the qualitative and quantitative adverse reaction profile of Actilyse in pulmonary embolism and acute ischaemic stroke is different from the profile in myocardial infarction.\nMyocardial Infarction: Cardiac Disorders: Very Common: Reperfusion arrhythmias which can be life threatening and may require the use of conventional antiarrhythmic therapies.\nMyocardial Infarctions and Pulmonary Embolism: Nervous System Disorders: Uncommon: Intracranial haemorrhage.\nAcute Ischaemic Stroke: Nervous System Disorders: Common: Intracranial haemorrhage. Symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhages represent the major adverse event (up to 10% of patients). However, this had not shown an increased overall morbidity or mortality.\nMyocardial Infarction, Pulmonary Embolism and Acute Ischaemic Stroke: Gastrointestinal Disorders: Common: Gastrointestinal tract bleeding, nausea, vomiting. Nausea and vomiting can also occur as symptoms of myocardial infarction. Uncommon: Retroperitonium and gingival bleeding.\nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Very Common: Superficial bleeding, normally from punctures or damaged blood vessels.\nInjury and Poisoning and Procedural Complications: Uncommon: Anaphylactoid reactions which are usually mild, but can be life threatening in isolated cases. They may appear as rash, urticaria, bronchospasm, angioedema, hypotension, shock or any other symptom associated with allergic reactions. If they occur, conventional antiallergic therapy should be initiated. In such cases, a relatively larger proportion of patients were receiving concomitant ACE inhibitors. No definite anaphylactic (IgE-mediated) reactions to Actilyse are known. Transient antibody formation to Actilyse has been observed in rare cases and with low titres, but a clinical relevance of this finding could not be established. Rare: Cholesterol crystal embolisation which may lead to corresponding consequences in the organs concerned.\nInvestigations: Very Common: Drop in blood pressure. Common: Increased temperature.\nReproductive System and Breast Disorders: Common: Urogenital tract bleeding.\nRespiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Common: Epistaxis.\nSurgical and Medical Procedures: Common: Necessary blood transfusion.\nVascular Disorders: Common: Ecchymosis. Uncommon: Thrombotic embolisation which may lead to corresponding consequences in the organs concerned. Rare: Bleeding of parenchymatous organs.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",

      "mechanism": "Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Fibrinolytic.\nPharmacology: The active ingredient of Actilyse is alteplase, a recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator. It is a glycoprotein that activates plasminogen directly to plasmin. When administered IV, alteplase remains relatively inactive in the circulatory system. Once bound to fibrin, it is activated, inducing the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin leading to the dissolution of the fibrin clot.\nAcute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) Patients: Two (2) Actilyse dose regimens have been studied in patients experiencing acute myocardial infarction. The comparative efficacy of these 2 regimens has not been evaluated.\nAccelerated Infusion in AMI Patients: Accelerated infusion of Actilyse was studied in an international, multi-center trial (GUSTO) that randomized 41,021 patients with acute myocardial infarction to 4 thrombolytic regimens. Administration of Actilyse 100 mg over 90 min, with concomitant IV heparin infusion, led to a lower mortality after 30 days (6.3%) as compared to the administration of streptokinase, 1.5 million IU over 60 min, with SC or IV heparin (7.3%). The 1% absolute decrease in 30-day mortality for Actilyse compared to streptokinase was statistically significant (p=0.007).\nActilyse treated patients showed higher infarct related vessel patency rates at 60 and 90 min after thrombolysis than the streptokinase-treated patients. No differences in patency rates were noted at =180 min.\nA large scale mortality trial (ASSENT 2) in approximately 17,000 patients showed that alteplase and tenecteplase are therapeutically equivalent in reducing mortality (6.2% for both treatments, at 30 days). The use of tenecteplase was associated with a significantly lower incidence of non-intracranial bleedings compared to alteplase (26.4% vs 28.9%, p=0.0003). The reduction of the risk of bleeding is likely to be related to the increased fibrin specificity of tenecteplase and to its weight adapted regimen.\nThree-Hour Infusion in AMI Patients: In a double-blind, randomized trial (5013 patients) comparing Actilyse to placebo (ASSET study) patients infused with Actilyse within 5 hrs of the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction experienced improved 30-day survival compared to those treated with placebo. At 1 month, the overall mortality rates were 7.2% for the Actilyse treated group and 9.8% for the placebo-treated group (p=0.001). This benefit was maintained at 6 months for Actilyse treated patients (10.4%) compared to those treated with placebo (13.1%, p=0.008).\nIn a double-blind, randomized trial (721 patients) comparing Actilyse to placebo, patients infused with Actilyse within 5 hrs of the onset of symptoms experienced improved ventricular function 10-22 days after treatment compared to the placebo group, when global ejection fraction was measured by contrast ventriculography (50.7% versus 48.5%, p=0.01). Patients treated with Actilyse had a 19% reduction in infarct size, as measured by cumulative release of HBD (a-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase) activity compared to placebo-treated patients (p=0.001). Patients treated with Actilyse had significantly fewer episodes of cardiogenic shock (p=0.02), ventricular fibrillation (p<0.04) and pericarditis (p=0.01) compared to patients treated with placebo. Mortality at 21 days in Actilyse treated patients was reduced to 3.7% compared to 6.3% in placebo-treated patients (1-sided, p=0.05). Although these data do not demonstrate unequivocally a significant reduction in mortality for this study, they do indicate a trend that is supported by the results of the ASSET study.\nIn a placebo controlled trial (LATE) in 5711 AMI patients with onset of symptoms between 6 and 24 hrs a 100-mg Actilyse over 3 hrs infusion was compared with placebo. A nonsignificant reduction of 14.1% (95% CI: 0-28.1%, p>0.05) in 30-day-mortality was observed with Actilyse. In a pre-specified survival analysis in patients treated within 12 hrs of symptom onset, a significant 25.6% reduction in mortality in favour of Actilyse (95% CI: 6.3-45%; p=0.023) was observed.\nPulmonary Embolism Patients: In a comparative randomized trial of alteplase versus urokinase in 63 patients with angiographically documented acute massive pulmonary embolism both treatment groups experienced a significant reduction in pulmonary embolism-induced pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary haemodynamics improved significantly faster with Actilyse than with urokinase.\nAcute Ischaemic Stroke Patients: Several studies have been carried out in the field of acute ischaemic stroke. The NINDS study is the only study without an upper age limit ie, which also included patients >80 years. All other randomized trials have excluded patients >80 years. Therefore, treatment decisions in this patient group require particular care on an individual patient basis.\nTwo (2) placebo-controlled, double-blind trials (NINDS t-PA Stroke Trial, Part 1 and Part 2) enrolled patients with measurable neurological deficit who could complete screening and begin study treatment within 3 hrs from symptom onset. A cranial computerized tomography (CT) scan was performed prior to treatment to rule out the presence of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (SICH). Patients were also excluded for the presence of conditions related to risks of bleeding, for minor neurological deficit, for rapidly improving symptoms prior to initiating study treatment, or for blood glucose of <50 mg/dL or >400 mg/dL. Patients were randomized to receive either Actilyse 0.9 mg/kg maximum of 90 mg, or placebo. Actilyse was administered as a 10% initial bolus >1 min followed by continuous IV infusion of the remainder over 60 min.\nThe initial study (NINDS-Part 1, n=291) evaluated neurological improvement at 24 hrs after stroke onset. The primary endpoint, the proportion of patients with a =4 point improvement in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or complete recovery (NIHSS score=0), was not significantly different between treatment groups. A secondary analysis suggested improved 3-months outcome associated with Actilyse treatment using the following stroke assessment scales: Barthel Index, Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Glasgow Outcome Scale, and the NIHSS. A second study (NINDS-Part 2, n=333) assessed clinical outcome at 3 months as the primary outcome. A favourable outcome was defined as minimal or no disability using the 4-stroke assessment scales: Barthel Index (score >95), Modified Rankin Scale (score <1), Glasgow Outcome Scale (score=1), and NIHSS (score <1). The odds ratio for favourable outcome in the Actilyse group was 1.7 (95% CI: 1.2-2.6). Compared to placebo there was 13% absolute increase in the number of patients with minimal or no disability (mRS 0-1) (OR 1.7; 95% CI: 1.1-2.6). There was also a consistent benefit seen with Actilyse on other neurologic and disability scales. Secondary analyses demonstrated consistent functional and neurological improvement within all four stroke scales as indicated by median scores. These results were highly consistent with the 3-months outcome treatment effects observed in the Part 1 study. The incidences of all-cause 90-day mortality, SICH, and new ischemic stroke following Actilyse treatment compared to placebo indicated a significant increase in symptomatic SICH (according to NINDS definition) following Actilyse treatment within 36 hrs (Actilyse 6.4%; Placebo 0.65%). In Actilyse treated patients, there were no increases compared to placebo in the incidences of 90-day mortality or severe disability (Actilyse 20.5%; Placebo 17.3%).\nA pooled analysis of 2775 patients from 6 major randomized clinical trials (NINDS part 1 and 2, two ECASS trial and ATLANTIS part A and B), 104 evaluated the disability status of patients treated with Actilyse or placebo. In this analysis, the odds of a favourable outcome at 3 months increased as the time to treatment with Actilyse decreased. A SICH rate was seen in 5.9% of patients treated with Actilyse [(versus 1.1% of controls (p<0.0001)] which was associated with age but not with time to treatment. This analysis strongly confirms that rapid treatment with Actilyse is associated with better outcomes at 3 months. It also provides evidence that the therapeutic window may extend as far out as 4.5 hrs.\nIn a large observational study (SITS-MOST: The Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke-Monitoring Study) the safety and efficacy of Actilyse for acute stroke treatment within 3 hrs in a routine clinical setting was assessed and compared with results from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). All patients had to be compliant with the European summary of the product characteristics of Actilyse treatment and outcome data of 6483 patients from 285 centres in 14 European countries were collected. Primary outcome were symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within 24 hrs and mortality at 3 months. The rate of SICH found in SITS-MOST was comparable with the SICH rate as reported in randomized trials 7.3% (95% CI: 6.7-8) in SITS-MOST versus 8.6% (95% CI: 6.1-11.1) in RCTs. Mortality was 11.3% (95% CI: 10.5-12.1) in SITS-MOST vs 17% (95% CI: 13.9-20.7) in RCTs. The results of SITS-MOST indicate that, the routine clinical use of Actilyse within 3 hrs of stroke onset is as safe as reported in randomized clinical trials.\nThe ECASS III trial as a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial conducted in patients with acute stroke in a time-window of 3-4.5 hrs. The study enrolled patients with measurable neurological deficit compliant with the European summary of product characteristics (SPC) except the time-window. After exclusion of brain haemorrhage or major infarction by computed tomography, patients with acute ischemic stroke were randomized in a 1:1 double-blind fashion to intravenous alteplase (0.9 mg/kg bodyweight) or placebo. The primary end point was disability at 90 days, dichotomized for favourable [modified Rankin scale (mRS 0-1) or unfavourable (mRS 2-6)] outcome. The principal secondary end point was a global outcome analysis of 4 neurologic and disability scores combined. Safety endpoints included mortality, SICH and serious adverse events. A total of 821 patients were (418 alteplase/403 placebo) randomized. More patients achieved favourable outcome with alteplase (52.4%) vs placebo [45.2%; odds ratio (OR), 1.34; 95% CI: 1.02-1.76; p=0.038]. On the global analysis, outcome was also improved (OR, 1.28; 95% CI: 1-1.65; p=0.048). The incidence of SICH was higher with alteplase vs placebo (any SICH 27% vs 17.6%, p=0.0012; SICH by NINDS definition 7.9% vs 3.5%, p=0.006). Mortality was low and not significantly different between alteplase (7.7%) and placebo (8.4%; p=0.681). The results of ECASS III show that Actilyse between 3 and 4.5 hrs after symptom onset significantly improves clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke.\nThe safety and efficacy of Actilyse for acute ischaemic stroke treatment up to 4.5 hrs time onset to treatment (OTT) has been assessed by an ongoing AIS registry (SITS-ISTR: The Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke Registry). Primary outcome and mortality data of 15,294 patients in the 0-3 hrs time window were compared with data from 947 patients treated between 3-4.5 hrs after onset of AIS. At 3 months, the incidence of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (according to the NINDS definition) was found to be slightly higher in the 3-4.5 hrs time window (9.13%; 95% CI: 7.38-11.24) as compared with the up to 3 hrs time window (7.49% CI: 7.07-7.93). Mortality rates were similar comparing the 3-4.5 hrs time window (12.4%) with the 0-3 hrs time window 12.3%.",

      "special-precautions": "Fluid Retention and Cardiac Failure: Actos can cause fluid retention, which may exacerbate or precipitate heart failure, when treating patients who have at least one risk factor for development of congestive heart failure (eg, prior myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease ), physicians should start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, particularly those with reduced cardiac reserve. Actos should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs. There have been cases of cardiac failure reported from the market when Actos was used in combination with insulin. Therefore, Actos is contraindicated in combination with insulin. There also have been case of cardiac failure reported from the market when Actos was used in patients with a history of cardiac failure. Since NSAID and Actos are associated with fluid retention, concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema.\nMonitoring of Liver Function: There have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience. It is recommended, therefore, that patients treated with Actos undergo periodic monitoring of liver enzymes. Liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with Actos in all patients. Therapy with Actos should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels (ALT >2.5 x ULN) or with any other evidence of liver disease.\nFollowing initiation of therapy with Actos, it is recommended that liver enzymes be monitored periodically based on clinical judgement. If ALT levels are increased to 3 x ULN during Actos therapy, liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible. If ALT levels remain >3 x ULN, therapy should be discontinued. If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked. The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with Actos should be guided by judgement pending laboratory evaluations. If jaundice is observed, drug therapy should be discontinued.\nWeight Gain: In clinical trials with Actos, there was evidence of dose-related weight gain, therefore weight should be closely monitored. Part of the treatment of diabetes is dietary control. Patients should be advised to adhere strictly to a caloric-controlled diet.\nHaematology: There was a 4% relative reduction in haemoglobin and 4.1% in haematocrit during therapy with Actos, consistent with haemodilution. Similar changes were seen in metformin (haemoglobin 3-4% and haematocrit 3.6-4.1% relative reduction) and to lesser extent sulfonylurea (haemoglobin 1-2% and haematocrit 1-3.2% relative reduction) treated pastients in comparative controlled trials with Actos.\nHypoglycaemia: As the consequences of increased insulin sensitivity, patients receiving pioglitazone in dual or triple oral therapy with sulfonylurea may be at risk for dose-related hypoglycaemia and reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea may be necessary.\nEye Disorders: Post-marketing reports of new onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone. Many of these patients reported concurrent peripheral edema. It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association between pioglitazone and macular edema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular edema, if patients report disturbances in visual acuity; an appropriate ophtamological referral should be considered.\nOthers: As a consequence of enhancing insulin action, Actos treatment in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome may result in resumption of ovulation. These patients may be at risk of pregnancy. Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become pregnant or if pregnancy occurs, the treatment should be discontinued.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate human data to determine the safety of pioglitazone during pregnancy. Foetal growth restriction was apparent in animal studies with Actos. This was attributable to the action of Actos in diminishing maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth. The relevance of such a mechanism in humans is unclear and Actos should not be used in pregnancy.\nActos has been shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether Actos is secreted in human milk. Therefore, Actos should not be administered to breastfeeding women.\nUse in children: Actos is not recommended for patients =18 years.",

Peak level is reached 2 hrs after administration. Plasma concentration increases proportionally with 2-60 mg administration. Steady state is reached after 4-7 days. Repeated dosing does not cause accumulation of its components or metabolites. Its absorption is not influenced by food. Absolute bioavailability is >80%.\nDistribution: The estimated volume of distribution in humans is about 0.25 L/kg. Pioglitazone and all of active metabolites are extremely bound with plasma protein (>99%).\nMetabolism: Actos is metabolised in the liver by hydroxylation of aliphatic methylene groups. This is predominantly via cytochrome P-450 2C9 and 3A4, although multiple other isoforms are involved to a lesser degree. Three of 6 of its metabolites are active (M-II, M-III and M-IV). When activity, concentrations and protein-binding are taken into account, Actos and metabolite M-III contribute equally to efficacy. On this basis, M-IV contribution to efficacy is approximately 3-fold that of Actos, whilst the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.\nElimination: Upon oral administration of radioactive Actos in men, the radiolabeled pioglitazone is found in the faeces (55%) and urine (45%). In animals, a small amount of intact pioglitazone is found in the urine or faeces. The mean half-time of elimination in man is 5-6 hrs (pioglitazone) and 16-23 hrs (active metabolites).\nElderly: Steady state in patients =65 years is similar in younger patients.\nPatients with Renal Failure: Concentration of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with renal failure than those with normal renal function but both have similar oral clearance. Concentration of intact pioglitazone remains unchanged.\nPatients with Liver Failure: Concentration of plasma pioglitazone is unchanged but the volume of distribution is increased and the intrinsic clearance decreased.",

      "dosage": "General: The use of Actosmet in the management of type 2 diabetes should be individualized on the basis of effectiveness and tolerability.\nDosage Recommendations: Usual Starting Dose: 15 mg/850 mg once or twice daily with food to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin.\nAfter initiation of Actosmet or with dose increase, patients should be carefully monitored for adverse events related to fluid retention (see Warnings).\nThe dosage of Actosmet should be gradually titrated, as needed, based on the adequacy of the therapeutic response.\nMaximum Daily Dose: 45 mg/2550 mg of pioglitazone/metformin. This maximal dosage should be administered in divided doses with meals.\nNo studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of Actosmet in patients previously treated with other oral hypoglycaemic agents and switched to Actosmet. Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring as changes in glycemic control can occur.\nSufficient time should be given to assess adequacy of therapeutic response. Ideally, the response to therapy should be evaluated using HbA1c, which is a better indicator of long-term glycemic control than FPG alone. HbA1c reflects glycemia over the past 2-3 months. In clinical use, it is recommended that patients be treated with Actosmet for a period of time adequate to evaluate change in HbA1c (8-12 weeks) unless glycemic control as measured by FPG deteriorates.",
      "over-dosage": "Pioglitazone Hydrochloride: During controlled clinical trials, 1 case of overdosage with pioglitazone was reported. A male patient took 120 mg daily for 4 days, then 180 mg daily for 7 days. The patient denied any clinical symptoms during this period.\nIn the event of overdosage, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to patient's clinical signs and symptoms.\nMetformin Hydrochloride: Overdosage of metformin hydrochloride has occurred, including ingestion of amounts >50 g. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin hydrochloride has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdosage cases (see Metformin Hydrochloride under Warnings). Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated metformin from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected.",

      "contra-indications": "Hypersensitivity to the pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride or to any of the excipients of Actosmet.\nCardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (NYHA stages I to IV); acute or chronic disease which may cause tissue hypoxia eg, cardiac or respiratory failure, recents myocardial infarction, shock; hepatic impairment; acute alcohol intoxication, alcoholism; diabetic ketoacidosis or diabetic pre-coma; renal failure or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance <60 mL/min). Acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function eg, dehydration, severe infection, shock, intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents (see Warning and Precautions). Current bladder cancer or a history of bladder cancer.\nUse in pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C: No preclinical or clinical data on exposed pregnancies or lactation are available.\nRisk Related to Pioglitazone: There are no adequate human data from the use of pioglitazone in pregnant women. Animal studies have not shown teratogenic effects but have shown foetoxicity related to the pharmacologic action (see Toxicology under Actions).\nRisk Related to Metformin: Animal studies have not revealed teratogenic effects. Small clinical trials have not revealed metformin to have malformative effects.\nHowever, Actosmet should not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing age not using contraceptive measures. If a patient wishes to become pregnant or if a pregnancy occurs, treatment with Actosmet should be discontinued.\nBoth pioglitazone and metformin have been shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether breast-feeding will lead to exposure of the infant to the medicinal product.\nActosmet must therefore not be used in women who are pregnant and breast-feeding (see Contraindications).\nUse in lactation: No studies have been conducted with the combined components of Actosmet. In studies performed with the individual components, both pioglitazone and metformin are secreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether pioglitazone and/or metformin is secreted in human milk.\nBecause many drugs are excreted in human milk, Actosmet should not be administered to a breastfeeding woman. If Actosmet is discontinued, and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered.\nWarnings Congestive Heart Failure: Thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, which is a component of Actosmet, cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure in some patients (see Pioglitazone Hydrochloride as follows). After initiation of Actosmet and after dose increases, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of heart failure (including excessive, rapid weight gain, dyspnea and/or edema). If these signs and symptoms develop, the heart failure should be managed according to the current standards of care. Furthermore, discontinuation or dose reduction of Actosmet must be considered.\nActosmet is not recommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure. Initiation of Actosmet in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure is contraindicated (see Contraindications and Pioglitazone Hydrochloride as follows).\nLactic Acidosis: Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation. The risk increases with conditions eg, sepsis, dehydration, excess alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency, renal impairment and acute congestive heart failure. The onset is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms eg, malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and nonspecific abdominal distress. Laboratory abnormalities include low pH, increased anion gap and elevated blood lactate. If acidosis is suspected, Actosmet should be discontinued and the patient hospitalized immediately (see texts as follows).\nMetformin Hydrochloride: Lactic Acidosis: Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with Actosmet (pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride) tablets; when it occurs, it is falal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 mcg/mL are generally found.\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In >20,000 patient-years exposure 10 metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients =80 years unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see General: Metformin Hydrochloride under Precautions).\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms eg, malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see General: Metformin Hydrochloride under Precautions). Metformin should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but <5 mmol/L in patients taking metformin do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms eg, poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling (see General: Metformin Hydrochloride under Precautions).\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia).\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery (see Contraindications and General: Metformin Hydrochloride under Precautions).\nPioglitazone Hydrochloride: Fluid Retention and Cardiac Failure: Pioglitazone can cause fluid retention, which may exacerbate or precipitate heart failure. When treating patients who have at least one risk factor for development of congestive heart failure (eg, prior myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease), physicians should start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually. Patients should be observed for sign and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema particularly those with reduced cardiac reserve. There have been cases of cardiac failure reported from the market when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure. Therefore Actos is contraindicated in combination with insulin. Since NSAID and Actos are associated with fluid retention, concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs.\nMonitoring of Liver Function: There have been rare report of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience. It is recommended, therefore, that patients treated with pioglitazone undergo periodic monitoring of liver enzymes.\nLiver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with pioglitazone in all patients. Therapy with pioglitazone should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels (ALT >2.5 x upper limit of normal) or with any other evidence of liver. Following initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, it is recommended that liver enzymes be monitored periodically based on clinical judgment. If ALT levels are increased to 3x upper limit of normal during pioglitazone therapy, liver enzymes should be reassessed as soon as possible. If ALT levels remain >3x the upper limit of normal, therapy should be discontinued. If any patients develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked. The decisions whether to continue the patients on therapy with pioglitazone should be guided by clinical judgement pending laboratory evaluations. If jaundice is observed, drug therapy should be discontinued.\nWeight Gain: In clinical trials with pioglitazone there was evidence of dose related weight gain, which may be due to fat accumulation and in some cases associated with fluid retention. In some cases weight increases may be a symptoms of cardiac failure, therefore weight should be closely monitored. Part of the treatment of diabetes is dietary control. Patients should be advised to adhere strictly to a calorie-controlled diet.\nHaematology: There was a small reduction in haemoglobin (4% relative reduction) and in haematocrit (4.1% relative reduction) during therapy with pioglitazone, consistent with haemodilution. Similar changes were seen in metformin (haemoglobin 3-4% and haematocrit 3.6-4.1% relative reduction) and to a lesser extent sulfonylurea (haemoglobin 1-2% and haematocrit 1-3.2% relative reduction) treated patients in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone. Actosmet may cause decreased in hemoglobin and hematocrit.\nHypoglycaemia: As a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity, patients receiving pioglitazone in dual or triple oral therapy with a sulphonylurea may be at risk for dose-related hypoglycaemia and a reduction in the dose of the sulphonylurea may be necessary.\nEye Disorders: Post-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual aculity have been been reported with thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone. Many of these patients reported concurrent peripheral edema. It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association between pioglitazone and macular edema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular edema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity; an appropriate opthalmological referral should be considered.\nOthers: An increased incidence in bone fractures in women was seen in a pooled analysis of adverse events reports of bone fractures from randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials in over 8100 pioglitazone and 7400 comparator treated patients, on treatment for up to 3.5 years.\nFractures were observed in 2.6% of women taking pioglitazone compared to 1.7% of women treated with a comparator. No increase in fracture reates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.3%) versus comparator (1.5%).\nThe fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fracture/100 patient-years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fracture/100 patient-years in women treated with comparator. The observed excess risk of fractures for women in this dataset on pioglitazone in therefore 0.8 fractures/100 patient-years of use.\nIn the 3.5 year cardiovascular risk PROactive study, 44/870 (5.1%; 1 fractures/100 patient-years) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures/100 patient-years) of female patients treated with comparator. No increased in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone.\nAs a consequences of enhancing insulin action, pioglitazone treatment in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome may result in resumption of ovulation. These patients may be risk of pregnancy.\nPatients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patients wishes to become pregnant or if pregnancy occurs the treatment should be discontinued.\nPioglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of cytochrome be monitored closely. Pioglitazone dose adjustment within the recommended posology or changes in diabetic treatment should be considered.\nThe tablets contain lactose monohydrate and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactose deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.\nMetformin: Monitoring of Renal Function and Concomitant Use with Other Medications that may Affect Renal Function: Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increase proportionally with the degree of impairment of renal function. Patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal value for their age should not receive Actosmet. In patients with advanced age, actosmet should be carefully titrated, because aging is associated with reduced renal function. In elderly patients, particularly those =80 years, therapy with Actosmet is not recommended, except creatinine clearance measurement shows no reduced renal function.\nIn patients whose development of renal dysfunction is anticipated, renal function should be assessed more frequently and Actosmet should be discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present.\nConcomitant medication(s) that may affect renal function or result in significant hemodynamic change or may interfere with the disposition of metformin eg, cationic drugs that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion, should be used with caution. The used of IV iodinated contrast materials can lead to acute alteration of renal function and lactic acidosis in patients receiving Actosmet. Therefore, for patients who will undergo such procedure, Actosmet should be temporary discontinued at the time of or prior to the procedure, and should not given in the next 48 hrs and may be reinstituted only after renal function has been reevaluated and found to be normal.\nHipoxic States: Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction and other conditions characterized by hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause pre-renal azotemia. Therapy should be discontinued promptly when such events occur in patients receiving Actosmet.\nSurgery: Therapy with Actosmet should be temporary suspended for any surgical procedure (except minor procedures not associated with restricted intake of food and fluids), and should not be restarted until the patient's oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal.\nAlcohol Intake: Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients, therefore, should be warned against excessive alcohol intake, acute or chronic, while receiving Actosmet.\nImpaired Hepatic Function: Since impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis, Actosmet should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\nVitamin B12 Levels: In controlled clinical trials of metformin at 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12 intrinsic factor complex, is however very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis in advised in patients on Actosmet and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12 measurements at 2-3 year intervals may be useful.\nChange in Clinical Status of Patients with Previously Controlled Type 2 Diabetes: In patients with type 2 diabetes previously well controlled on Actosmet who develops laboratory abnormalities or clinical illness (especially vague and poorly defined illness) should be evaluated promptly for evidence of ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis. Evaluation should be include serum electrolytes and ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood PH, lactate pyruvate and metformin levels. If acidosis of either form accurs, Actosmet must be stopped immediately and other appropriate corrective measure initiated (see Metformin Hydrochloride as previously mentioned).\nLaboratory Test: FPG and A1C measurements should be performed periodically to monitor glycemic control and therapeutic response to Actosmet.\nLiver enzyme monitoring us recommended prior to initiation of therapy with Actosmet in all patients and periodically thereafter per the clinical judgment of the healthcare professional (see General: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride under Precautions and Serum Transaminase Levels under Adverse Reactions).\nInitial and periodic monitoring of hematologic parameters (eg, hemoglobin/hematocrit and red blood cells indices) and renal function (serum creatinine) should be performed, at least on an annual basis. While megaloblastic anemia has rarely been seen with metformin therapy, if this is suspected, vitamin B12 deficiency should be excluded.",
      "special-precautions": "Lactic Acidosis: Lactic acidosis is a very rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation. Reported cases of lactic acidosis in patients on metformin have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal failure. The incidence of lactic acidosis can and should be reduced by assessing also other associated risk factors eg, poorly controlled diabetes, ketosis, plolonged fasting, excessive alcohol intake, hepatic insufficiency and any condition associated with hypoxia.\nDiagnosis: Lactic acidosis is characterized by acidotic dyspnoea, abdominal pain and hypothermia followed by coma. Diagnostic laboratory findings are decreased blood pH, plasma lactate levels >5mmol/L, and an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio. If metabolic acidosis is suspected, treatment with the medicinal product should be discontinued and the patient hospitalised immediately (see Overdosage).\nRenal Function: As metformin is excreted by the kidney, serum creatinine concentrations should be determined regularly at least once a year in patients with normal renal function or at least 2-4 times a year in patients with serum creatinine levels at the upper limits of normal and in elderly subjects.\nDecreased renal function in elderly patients is frequent and asymptomatic. Special caution should be exercised in situations where renal function may become impaired ie, when initiating antihypertensive therapy or diuretic therapy and when starting treatment with a NSAID.\nSurgery: As Actosmet contains metformin hydrochloride, the treatment should be discontinued 48 hrs before elective surgery with general anaesthesia and should not be usually resumed earlier than 48 hrs afterwards.\nAdministration of Iodinated Contrast Agent: The intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents in radiological can lead discontinued prior to, or at the time of the test and not reinstituted until 48 hrs afterwards and only after renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be normal.\nPolycystic Ovarian Syndrome: As a consequence of enhancing insulin action, pioglitazone treatment in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome may result in resumption of ovulation. These patients may be at risk of pregnancy. Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become pregnant or if pregnancy occurs, the treatment should be discontinued.\nBladder Cancer: Risk factors for bladder cancer should be assessed before initiating pioglitazone treatment (risks include age, smoking history, exposure to some occupational or chemotherapy agents eg, cyclophosphamide or prior radiation treatment in the pelvic region).\nAny macroscopic haematuria should be investigated before starting pioglitazone therapy. Patients should be advised to promptly seek the attention of the physician if macroscopic haematuria or other symptoms eg, dysuria or urinary urgency develop during treatment.\nPatients who received pioglitazone more than 1 year, should be evaluated periodically for bladder cancer risk by urinalysis.\nInformation for Patients: Patients should be instructed regarding the importance of adhering to dietary instructions, a regular exercise program, and regular testing of blood glucose and HbA1c. During periods of stress eg, fever, trauma, infection or surgery, medication requirements may change, and patients should be reminded to seek medical advice promptly.\nThe risks of lactic acidosis, its symptoms and conditions that predispose to its development, as noted should be explained to patients. Patients should be advised to discontinue Actosmet immediately and to promptly notify the healthcare professional if unexplained hyperventilation, myalgia, malaise, unusual somnolence or other nonspecific symptoms occur.\nGastrointestinal symptoms are common during initiation of metformin treatment and may occur during initiation of Actosmet therapy; however, patients should consult with the physician if they develop unexplained symptoms. Although gastrointestinal symptoms that occur after stabilization are unlikely to be drug related, such an occurrence of symptoms should be evaluated to determine if it may be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\nPatients should be counseled against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, while receiving Actosmet. Patients who experience an unusually rapid increase in weight or edema, or who develop shortness of breath or other symptoms of heart failure while on Actosmet should immediately report these symptoms to the physician.\nPatients should be told that blood tests for liver function will be performed prior to the start of therapy and periodically thereafter per the clinical judgment of the healthcare professional.\nPatients should be told to seek immediate medical advice for unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia or dark urine.\nPatients should be informed about the importance of regular testing of renal function and hematologic parameters when receiving treatment with Actosmet.\nTherapy with a thiazolidinedione, which is the active pioglitazone component of the Actosmet tablet, may result in ovulation in some premenopausal anovulatory women. As a result, these patients may be at an increased risk for pregnancy while taking Actosmet. Thus, adequate contraception in premenopausal women should be recommended. This possible effect has not been investigated in clinical studies so the frequency of this occurrence is not known.\nCombination antihyperglycemic therapy may cause hypoglycemia. When initiating Actosmet, the risks of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development should be explained to patients.\nPatients should be told to take Actosmet as prescribed and instructed that any change in dosing should only be done if directed by the physician. Patients should be informed that if a dose is missed, to take the next dose as prescribed unless directed otherwise by the physician. Patients should be informed that Actosmet must be swallowed whole and not chewed, cut or crushed, and that the inactive ingredients may occasionally be eliminated in the feces as a soft mass that may resemble the original tablet.\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Actosmet: No animal studies have been conducted with Actosmet. The following data are based on findings in studies performed with pioglilazone or metformin individually.\nPioglitazone Hydrochloride: A 2-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats at oral doses up to 63 mg/kg (approximately 14 times the maximum recommended human oral dose of 45 mg based on mg/m2). Drug-induced tumors were not observed in any organ except for the urinary bladder. Benign and/or malignant transitional cell neoplasms were observed in male rats at 4 mg/kg daily and above (approximately equal to the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m2). A 2-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg daily (approximately 11 times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m2). No drug-induced tumors were observed in any organ.\nDuring prospective evaluation of urinary cytology involving >1800 patients receiving pioglitazone in clinical trials up to one year in duration, no new cases of bladder tumors were identified. In two 3-year studies in which pioglitazone was compared to placebo or glyburide, there were 16/3656 (0.44%) reports of bladder cancer in patients taking pioglitazone compared to 5/3679 (0.14%) in patients not taking pioglitazone. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was <1 year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.16%) cases on pioglitazone and 2 (0.05%) on placebo.\nPioglitazone hydrochloride was not mutagenic in a battery of genetic toxicology studies, including the Ames bacterial assay, a mammalian cell forward gene mutation assay (CHO/HPRT and AS52/XPRT), an in vitro cytogenetics assay using CHL cells, an unscheduled DNA synthesis assay and an in vivo micronucleus assay.\nNo adverse effects upon fertility were observed in male and female rats at oral doses up to pioglitazone hydrochloride 40 mg/kg daily prior to and throughout mating and gestation (approximately 9 times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m2).\nMetformin Hydrochloride: Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg daily and 1500 mg/kg daily, respectively. These doses are both approximately 4 times a human daily dose of 2000 mg of the metformin component of Actosmet based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with melformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg daily.\nThere was no evidence of mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests: Ames test (S. typhimurium), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells) or chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes). Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative.\nFertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg daily, which is approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of the metformin component of Actosmet based on body surface area comparisons.\nUse in children: Safety and effectiveness of Actosmet in pediatric patients have not been established. Use in pediatric patients is not recommended for the treatment of diabetes due to lack of long-term safety data. Risks including fractures and other adverse effects associated with pioglitazone, 1 of the components of Actosmet, have not been determined in this population (see Warnings).\nUse in the elderly: Pioglilazone Hydrochloride: Approximately 500 patients in placebo-controlled clinical trials of pioglitazone were =65 years. No significant differences in effectiveness and safety were observed between these patients and younger patients.\nMetformin Hydrochloride: Controlled clinical studies of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and young patients. Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and because the risk of serious adverse reactions to the drug is greater in patients with impaired renal function, Actosmet should only be used in patients with normal renal function (see Special Populations under Actions, Contraindications and Metformin Hydrochloride under Warnings). Because aging is associated with reduced renal function, Actosmet should be used with caution as age increases. Care should be taken in dose selection and should be based on careful and regular monitoring of renal function. Generally, elderly patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of Actosmet (see Dosage and Administration and Metformin Hydrochloride under Warnings).",
      "adverse-reactions": "Over 8500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials. This includes 2605 high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes treated with pioglitazone from the PROactive clinical trial. Over 6000 patients have been treated for =6 months and over 4500 patients for 1 year or longer. Over 3000 patients have received pioglitazone for at least 2 years.\nThe most common adverse events reported in at least 5% of patients in the controlled 16-week clinical trial between placebo plus metformin and pioglitazone 30 mg plus metformin were upper respiratory tract infection (15.6% and 15.5%), diarrhea (6.3% and 4.8%), combined edema/peripheral edema (2.5% and 6%) and headache (1.9% and 6%), respectively.\nThe incidence and type of adverse events reported in at least 5% of patients in any combined treatment group from the 24-week study comparing pioglitazone 30 mg plus metformin, and pioglitazone 45 mg plus metformin are shown in Table 2; the rate of adverse events resulting in study discontinuation between the 2 treatment groups was 7.8% and 7.7%, respectively.\nMost clinical adverse events were similar between groups treated with pioglitazone in combination with metformin and those treated with pioglitazone monotherapy. Other adverse events reported in at least 5% of patients in controlled clinical trials between placebo and pioglitazone monotherapy included myalgia (2.7% and 5.4%), tooth disorder (2.3% and 5.3%), diabetes mellitus aggravated (8.1% and 5.1%) and pharyngitis (0.8% and 5.1%), respectively.\nIn US, double-blind studies, anemia was reported in =2% of patients treated with pioglitazone plus metformin (see General: Piogliitazone Hydrochloride under Precautions).\nIn monotherapy studies, edema was reported for 4.8% (with doses from 7.5-45 mg) of patients treated with pioglitazone versus 1.2% of placebo-treated patients. Most of these events were considered mild or moderate in intensity (see General: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride under Precautions).\nProspective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events (PROactive): In PROactive, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a prior history of macrovascular disease were treated with Actos (n=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily, or placebo (n=2633), in addition to standard of care. Almost all subjects (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (ß-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium-channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins, fibrates). Patients had a mean age of 61.8 years, mean duration of diabetes 9.5 years and mean HbA1c 8.1%. Average duration of follow-up was 34.5 months. The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of Actos on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in the cardiovascular composite endpoint (see Table 3). Although there was no statistically significant difference between Actos and placebo for the 3-year incidence of a first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with Actos.\nPost-marketing reports of new onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity have also been received (see General: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride under Precautions).\nLaboratory Abnormalities: Hematologic: Pioglitazone may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. The fall in hemoglobin and hematocrit with pioglitazone appears to be dose related. Across all clinical studies, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone. These changes generally occurred within the first 4-12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively stable thereafter.\nThese changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone therapy and have rarely been associated with any significant hematologic clinical effects (see General: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride under Precautions).\nIn controlled clinical trials of metformin at 29 weeks' duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation (see General: Metformin Hydrochloride under Precautions).\nSerum Transaminase Levels: During all clinical studies in the US, 14 of 4780 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone had ALT values =3 times the upper limit of normal during treatment. All patients with follow-up values had reversible elevations in ALT. In the population of patients treated with pioglitazone, mean values for bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferace (AST), ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and ?-glutamyl transferase (GGT) were decreased at the final visit compared with baseline. Fewer than 0.9% of patients treated with pioglitazone were withdrawn from clinical trials in the US due to abnormal liver function tests.\nIn pre-approval clinical trials, there were no cases of idiosyncratic drug reactions leading to hepatic failure (see General: PiogJitazone Hydrochloride under Precautions).\nCreatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Levels: During required laboratory testing in clinical trials with pioglitazone, sporadic, transient elevations in CPK levels were observed. An isolated elevation to >10 times the upper limit of normal was noted in 9 patients (values of 2150-11,400 IU/L). Six of these patients continued to receive pioglitazone, 2 patients had completed receiving study medication at the time of the elevated value and 1 patient discontinued study medication due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone therapy is unknown.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "Pioglitazone Hydrochloride: In vivo drug-drug interaction studies have suggested that pioglitazone may be a weak inducer of CYP450 isoform 3A4 substrate.\nAn enzyme inhibitor of CYP2C8 (eg, gemfibrozil) may significantly increase the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of pioglitazone and an enzyme inducer of CYP2CB (eg, rifampin) may significantly decrease the AUC of piogJitazone. Therefore. if an inhibitor or inducer of CYP2CB is started or stopped during treatment with pioglitazone, changes in diabetes treatment may be needed based on clinical response (see Drug-Drug Interactions: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride under Actions).\nMetformin Hydrochloride: Glyburide: In a single-dose interaction study in type 2 diabetes patients, co-administration of metformin and glyburide did not result in any changes in either metformin pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Decreases in glyburide AUC and Cmax were observed, but were highly variable. The single-dose nature of this study and the lack of correlation between glyburide blood levels and pharmacodynamic effects, makes the clinical significance of this interaction uncertain.\nFurosemide: A single-dose, metformin-furosemide drug interaction study in healthy subjects demonstrated that pharmacokinetic parameters of both compounds were affected by co-administration. Furosemide increased the metformin plasma and blood Cmax by 22%, and blood AUC by 15%, without any significant change in metformin renal clearance. When administered with metformin, the Cmax and AUC of furosemide were 31% and 12% smaller, respectively, than when administered alone and the terminal half-life was decreased by 32%, without any significant change in furosemide renal clearance. No information is available about the interaction of metformin and furosemide when co-administered chronically.\nNifedipine: A single-dose, metformin-nifedipine drug interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that co-administration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount excreted in the urine. Maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Metformin had minimal effects on nifedipine.\nCationic Drugs: Cationic drugs (eg, amiloride, digoxin, morphine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, ranitidine, triamterene, trimethoprim and vancomycin) that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion theoretically have the potential for interaction with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. Such interaction between metformin and oral cimetidine has been observed in normal healthy volunteers in both single- and multiple-dose, metformin-cimetidine drug interaction studies with a 60% increase in peak metformin plasma, and whole blood concentrations and a 40% increase in plasma and whole blood metformin AUC. There was no change in elimination half-life in the single-dose study. Metformin had no effect on cimetidine pharmacokinetics. Although such interactions remain theoretical (except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of Actosmet and/or the interfering drug is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via the proximal renal tubular secretory system.\nOther: Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. These drugs include thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium-channel blocking drugs and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Actosmet, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia.\nIn healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of metformin and propranolol, and metformin and ibuprofen were not affected when co-administered in single-dose interaction studies.\nMetformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein bound drugs eg, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol and probenecid.",

      "description": "Each tablet contains pioglitazone hydrochloride 15 mg and metformin hydrochloride 850 mg.\nActosmet tablets contain 2 oral antihyperglycemic drugs used in the management of type 2 diabetes: Pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride. The concomitant use of pioglitazone and metformin has been previously approved based on clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin. Additional efficacy and safety information about pioglitazone and metformin monotherapies may be found in the prescribing information for each individual drug.\nPioglitazone hydrochloride is an oral antihyperglycemic agent that acts primarily by decreasing insulin resistance. Pioglitazone is used in the management of type 2 diabetes. Pharmacological studies indicate that pioglitazone improves sensitivity to insulin in muscle and adipose tissue, and inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis. Pioglitazone improves glycemic control while reducing circulating insulin levels.\nPioglitazone [(±-5-[[4-[2-(5-ethyl-2-pyridinyl)ethoxy]phenyl]methyl]-2,4-thiazolidinedione monohydrochloride belongs to a different chemical class and has a different pharmacological action than the sulfonylureas, biguanides, or the a-glucosidase inhibitors. The molecule contains 1 aymmetric center, and the synthetic compound is a racemate. The 2 enantiomers of pioglitazone interconvert in vivo.\nPioglitazone hydrochloride is an odorless white crystalline powder that has a molecular formula of C19H20N2O3S·HCl and molecular weight of 392.9. It is soluble in N,N-dimethylformamide, slightly soluble in anhydrous ethanol, very slightly soluble in acetone and acetonitrile, practically insoluble in water, and insoluble in ether.\nMetformin hydrochloride (N,N-dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide hydrochloride) is not chemically or pharmacologically related to any other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin hydrochloride is a white crystalline powder with a molecular formula of C4H11N5·HCl and molecular weight of 165.62. Metformin hydrochloride is freely soluble in water and is practically insoluble in acetone, ether and chloroform. The pKa of metformin is 12.4. The pH of a 1% aqueous solution of metformin hydrochloride is 6.68.",
      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Mechanism of Action: Actosmet combines 2 antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with the type 2 diabetes: Pioglitazone hydrochloride, a member of the thiazolidinedione class, and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class. Thiazolidinediones are insulin-sensitizing agents that act primarily by enhancing peripheral glucose utilization, whereas biguanides act primarily by decreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production.\nPioglitazone Hydrochloride: Pioglitazone depends on the presence of insulin for its metabolism of action. Piolitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal, and decreased hepatic glucose output. Unlike sulfonylureas, piogltiazone is not an insulin secretagogue. Pioglitazone is a potent and highly selective agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-? (PPAR?). PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action eg, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. Activation of PPAR? nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.\nIn animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states eg, type 2 diabetes. The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.\nSince pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin (by decreasing insulin resistance), it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogeous insulin.\nMetformin Hydrochloride: Metformin hydrochloride improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreased hepatic glucose production, decreased intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects (except in special circumstances, see General: Metformin Hydrochloride under Precautions) and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.\nPharmacodynamics: Clinical Effects: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride: Clinical studies demonstrate that pioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients. Pioglitazone enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal, improves hepatic sensitivity to insulin, and improves dysfunctional glucose homeostasis. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the decreased insulin resistance produced by pioglitazone results in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin levels, and lower HbA1c values. Based on results from an open-label extension study, the glucose-lowering effects of pioglitazone appear to persist for at least 1 year. In controlled clinical studies, pioglitazone in combination with metformin had an additive effect on glycemic control.\nPatients with lipid abnormalities were included in placebo-controlled monotherapy clinical studies with pioglitazone. Overall, patients treated with pioglitazone had mean decreases in triglycerides, mean increases in HDL-cholesterol, and no consistent mean changes in LDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol compared to the placebo group. A similar pattern of results was seen in 16- and 24-week combination therapy studies of pioglitazone with metformin.\nPharmacokinetics: Absorption and Bioavailability: In bioequivalence studies of Actosmet 15 mg/850 mg, the area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) of both the pioglitazone and the metformin component following a single dose of the combination tablet were bioequivalent to Actos 15 mg concomitantly administered with metformin hydrochloride 850-mg tablet under fasted conditions in healthy subjects (see Table 1).\nAdministration of Actosmet 15 mg/850 mg with food resulted in no change in overall exposure of pioglitazone. With metformin there was no change in AUC, however mean peak serum concentration of metformin was decreased by 28% when administered with food. A delayed time to peak serum concentration was observed for both components (1.9 hrs for pioglitazone and 0.8 hrs for metformin) under fed conditions. These changes are not likely to be clinically significant.\nPioglitazone Hydrochloride: Following oral administration, in the fasting state, pioglitazone is 1st measurable in serum within 30 min, with peak concentrations observed within 2 hrs. Food slightly delays the time to peak serum concentration to 3-4 hrs, but does not alter the extent of absorption.\nMetformin Hydrochloride: The absolute bioavailabifity of a metformin 500-mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50 or 60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin tablets of 500 mg to 1500 mg and 850 mg to 2550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination.\nFood decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration, a 25% lower AUC in plasma concentration versus time curve and a 35 min prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration following administration of a single 850-mg tablet of metformin with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown.\nDistribution: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride: The mean apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of pioglitazone following single-dose administration is 0.63±0.41 (mean±SD) L/kg of body weight. Pioglitazone is extensively protein bound (>99%) in human serum, principally to serum albumin. Pioglitazone also binds to other serum proteins, but with lower affinity. Metabolites M-III and M-IV also are extensively bound (>98%) to serum albumin.\nMetformin Hydrochloride: The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of 850 mg averaged 654±358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24-48 hrs and are generally <1 mcg/mL. During controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5 mcg/mL, even at maximum doses.\nMetabolism, Elimination and Excretion: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride: Pioglitazone is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation and oxidation; the metabolites also partly convert to glucuronide or sulfate conjugates. Metabolites M-II and M-IV (hydroxy derivatives of pioglitazone) and M-III (keto derivative of pioglitazone) are pharmacologically active in animal models of type 2 diabetes. In addition to pioglitazone, M-III and M-IV are the principal drug-related species found in human serum following multiple dosing. At steady state, in both healthy volunteers and in patients with type 2 diabetes, pioglitazone comprises approximately 30-50% of the total peak serum concentrations and 20-25% of the total AUC.\nIn vitro data demonstrate that multiple CYP isoforms are involved in the metabolism of pioglitazone. The cytochrome P4-50 isoforms involved are CYP2C8 and, to a lesser degree, CYP3A4 with additional contributions from a variety of other isoforms including the mainly extrahepatic CYP1A1. In vivo studies of pioglitazone in combination with P450 inhibitors and substrates have been performed (see Precautions and Interactions: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride). Urinary 6ß-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratios measured in patients treated with pioglitazone showed that pioglitazone is not a strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducer.\nFollowing oral administration, approximately 15-30% of the pioglitazone dose is recovered in the urine. Renal elimination of pioglitazone is negligible and the drug is excreted primarily as metabolites and the conjugates. It is presumed that most of the oral dose is excreted into the bile either unchanged or as metabolites and eliminated in the feces.\nThe mean serum half-life of pioglitazone and total pioglitazone ranges from 3-7 hrs and 16-24 hrs, respectively. Pioglitazone has an apparent clearance, CL/F, calculated to be 5-7 L/hr.\nMetformin Hydrochloride: IV single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance (CrCl) which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hrs, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hrs. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hrs, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.\nSpecial Populations: Renal Insufficiency: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride: The serum elimination half-life of pioglitazone, M-III and M-IV remains unchanged in patients with moderate (CrCl 30-60 mL/min) to severe (CrCl <30 mL/min) renal impairment when compared to normal subjects.\nMetformin Hydrochloride: In patients with decreased renal function (based on CrCl), the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased in proportion to the decrease in CrCl (see Clinical Effects and Pharmacokinetics: Metformin Hydrochloride under Actions, Contraindications and Warnings). Since metformin is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment, Actosmet is also contraindicated in these patients.\nHepatic Insufficiency: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride: Compared with normal controls, subjects with impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Grade B/C) have an approximate 45% reduction in pioglitazone and total pioglitazone mean peak concentrations but no change in the mean AUC values.\nTherapy with Actosmet should not be initiated if the patient exhibits clinical evidence of active liver disease or serum transaminase levels (ALT) exceed 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (see General: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride under Precautions).\nMetformin Hydrochloride: No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in subjects with hepatic insufficiency.\nElderly: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride: In healthy elderly subjects, peak serum concentrations of pioglitazone and total pioglitazone are not significantly different, but AUC values are slightly higher and the terminal half-life values slightly longer than for younger subjects. These changes were not of a magnitude that would be considered clinically relevant.\nMetformin Hydrochloride: Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and Cmax is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function.\nActosmet treatment should not be initiated in patients =80 years unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced (see Dosage and Administration and Warnings).\nPediatrics: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride: Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available. Use in pediatric patients is not recommended for the treatment of diabetes due to lack of long-term safety data. Risks including fractures and other adverse effects associated with pioglitazone, one of the components of Actosmet, have not been determined in this population (see Warnings and Precautions).\nMetformin Hydrochloride: After administration of a single oral metformin 500-mg tablet with food, geometric mean metformin Cmax and AUC differed <5% between pediatric type 2 diabetic patients (12-16 years) and gender- and weight-matched healthy adults (20-45 years), and all with normal renal function.\nGender: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride: As monotherapy and in combination with sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin, pioglitazone improved glycemic control in both males and females. The mean C max and AUC values were increased 20-60% in females. In controlled clinical trials, decreases from baseline in HbA1c were generally greater for females than for males (average mean difference in HbA1c 0.5%). Since therapy should be individualized for each patient to achieve glycemic control, no dose adjustment is recommended based on gender alone.\nMetformin Hydrochloride: Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes when analyzed according to gender (males=19, females=16). Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females.\nEthnicity: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride: Pharmacokinetic data among various ethnic groups are not available.\nMetformin Hydrochloride: No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Whites (n=249), Blacks (n=51) and Hispanics (n=24).\nDrug-Drug Interactions: Co-administration of a single dose of metformin (1000 mg) and pioglitazone after 7 days of pioglitazone (45 mg) did not alter the pharmacokinetics of the single dose of metformin. Specific pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with Actosmet have not been performed, although such studies have been conducted with the individual pioglitazone and metformin components.\nPioglitazone Hydrochloride: The following drugs were studied in healthy volunteers with co-administration of pioglitazone 45 mg once daily. Results are listed as follows: Oral Contraceptives: Co-administration of pioglitazone (45 mg once daily) and an oral contraceptive (norethindrone 1 mg plus ethinyl estradiol 0.035 mg once daily) for 21 days, resulted in 11% and 11-14% decrease in ethinyl estradiol AUC(0-24 hr) and Cmax respectively. There were no significant changes in norethindrone AUC(024 hr) and Cmax. In view of the high variability of ethinyl estradiol pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown.\nMidazolam: Administration of pioglitazone for 15 days followed by a single 7.5 mg dose of midazolam syrup resulted in a 26% reduction in midazolam Cmax and AUC.\nNifedipine ER: Co-administration of pioglitazone for 7 days with nifedipine ER 30 mg administered orally once daily for 4 days to male and female volunteers resulted in a ratio of least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged nifedipine of 0.83 (0.73-0.95) for Cmax and 0.88 (0.8-0.96) for AUC. In view of the high variability of nifedipine pharmacokinetics, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown.\nKetoconazole: Co-administration of pioglitazone for 7 days with ketoconazole 200 mg administered twice daily resulted in a ratio of least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged pioglitazone of 1.14 (1.06-1.23) for Cmax, 1.34 (1.26-1.41) for AUC and 1.87 (1.71-2.04) for Cmin.\nAtorvastatin Calcium: Co-administration of pioglilazone for 7 days with atorvastatin calcium (Lipitor) 80 mg once daily resulted in a ratio of least square mean (90% CI) values for unchanged pioglitazone of 0.69 (0.57-0.85) for Cmax, 0.76 (0.65-0.88) for AUC and 0.96 (0.87- 1.05) for Cmin. For unchanged atorvastatin the ratio of least square mean (90% CI) values were 0.77 (0.66-0.9) for Cmax, 0.86 (0.78-0.94) for AUC and 0.92 (0.82-1.02) for Cmin.\nCytochrome P-450: See Precautions and Interactions: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride.\nGemfibrozil: Concomitant administration of gemfibrozil (oral 600 mg twice daily), an inhibitor of CYP2C8, with pioglitazone (oral 30 mg) in 10 healthy volunteers pre-treated for 2 days prior with gemfibrozil (oral 600 mg twice daily) resulted in pioglitazone exposure (AUC0-24 hr) being 226% of the pioglitazone exposure in the absence of gemfibrozif (see Precautions and Interactions: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride).\nRifampin: Concomitant administration of rifampin (oral 600 mg once daily), an inducer of CYP2CB with pioglitazone (oral 30 mg) in 10 healthy volunteers pretreated for 5 days prior with rifampin (oral 600 mg once daily) resulted in a decrease in the AUC of pioglitazone by 54% (see Precautions and Interactions: Poglitazone Hydrochloride).\nIn other drug-drug interaction studies, pioglitazone had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine, glipizide, digoxin, warfarin, ranitidine hydrochloride or theophylline.\nMetformin Hydrochloride: See Precautions and Interactions: Metformin Hydrochloride.\nToxicology: Animal Toxicity: Pioglitazone Hydrochloride: Heart enlargement has been observed in mice (100 mg/kg), rats (=4 mg/kg) and dogs (3 mg/kg) treated orally with the pioglitazone hydrochloride component of Actosmet (approximately 11, 1 and 2 times the maximum recommended human oral dose for mice, rats and dogs, respectively, based on mg/m2). In a 1-year rat study, drug-related early death due to apparent heart dysfunction occurred at an oral dose of 160 mg/kg daily (approximately 35 times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m2 ). Heart enlargement was seen in a 13-week study in monkeys at oral doses of =8.9 mg/kg (approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m2), but not in a 52-week study at oral doses up to 32 mg/kg (approximately 13 times the maximum recommended human oral dose based on mg/m2).",

An injection should be followed by a meal or a snack containing carbohydrates within 30 min.\nDosage is individualized and determined by the physician in accordance with the needs of the patient. The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1 IU/kg daily. The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance (eg, during puberty, in the young or due to obesity) and lower in patients with residual, endogenous insulin production.\nIn patients with diabetes mellitus, optimized glycemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications. Optimized metabolic control, including close blood glucose monitoring, is therefore recommended.\nDosage Adjustment: Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement.\nAdministration: For SC and IV use.\nActrapid HM/Penfill is usually administered SC into the abdominal wall. The thigh, the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used.\nSubcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures faster absorption than from other injection sites.\nInjection into a lifted skinfold minimizes the risk of unintended IM injection.\nInjection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy.\nIntramuscular administrations are possible under guidance by a physician.\nActrapid HM/Penfill may also be administered IV, which should only be carried out by healthcare professionals.\nActrapid HM: Actrapid HM vials are for single-person use only with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale.\nInjecting Actrapid HM on Its Own: Disinfect the rubber membrane.

Keep the needle under the skin for at least 6 sec to make sure the full dose has been delivered.\nActrapid Penfill: Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems and NovoFine or NovoTwist needles.\nIf the patient is treated with Actrapid Penfill and another insulin penfill cartridge, 2 insulin delivery systems should be used, one for each type of insulin. Actrapid Penfill is for single-person use only and should not be refilled.\nAlways check the cartridge, including the rubber plunger (stopper). Do not use it if any damage is seen or if there is a gap between the rubber plunger and the white label band. See the diagram inside the cover of the delivery system manual for the names of the different parts of Penfill. Disinfect the rubber membrane with a medicinal swab.\nHow to Inject: Inject the insulin under the skin. Keep the needle under the skin for at least 6 sec to make sure the full dose has been delivered. After each injection, be sure to remove the needle. Otherwise, the liquid may leak out when the temperature changes and the strength of the insulin may change.\nStability: For IV use, infusion systems with Actrapid HM 100 IU/mL at concentrations from 0.05-1 IU/mL human insulin in the infusion fluids 0.9% sodium chloride, 5% and 10% dextrose in 40 mmol/L potassium chloride using polypropylene infusion bags are stable at room temperature for 24 hrs. Although stable over time, a certain amount of insulin will initially be absorbed to the material of the infusion bag. Monitoring of blood glucose is necessary during the infusion.",
      "over-dosage": "There are no specific overdose definitions for insulins. However, hypoglycemia may develop over sequential stages, if too high doses relative to the patient's requirements are administered:\nMild hypoglycemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient constantly carries some sugar-containing products.\nSevere hypoglycemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated with glucagon (0.5-1 mg) given IM or SC by a person who has received appropriate instruction or glucose given IV by a medical professional. Glucose must be given IV if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10-15 min. Upon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse.",
      "administration": "Should be taken with food: Administer 30 min before meals. Administration should be followed by a meal/snack containing carbohydrates w/in 30 min.",
      "contra-indications": "Hypersensitivity to human insulin or any of the excipients of Actrapid HM/Penfill. Hypoglycemia.",
      "special-precautions": "Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment, especially in type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus), may lead to hyperglycemia.\nThe 1st symptoms of hyperglycemia usually set in gradually, over a period of hours or days. They include nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, flushed dry skin, dry mouth, increased frequency of urination, thirst and loss of appetite as well as acetone odor of the breath.\nIn type 1 diabetes, untreated hyperglycemic events lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is potentially lethal.\nHypoglycemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. Omission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycemia. Patients whose blood glucose control has greatly improved eg, by intensified insulin therapy, may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycemia and should be advised accordingly.\nConcomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patient's insulin requirement.\nRenal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement.\nAdjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients increase their physical activities or change their usual diet.\nWhen patients are transferred between different types of insulin products, the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may change or become less pronounced than those experienced with their previous insulin. Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under medical supervision. Changes in strength, brand, type, species (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need for a change in dosage.\nIf an adjustment is needed, it may be done with the 1st dose or during the 1st few weeks or months.\nAs with any insulin therapy, injection site reactions may occur and include pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruise, swelling and itching. Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. On certain cases, injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actrapid HM/Penfill.\nBefore traveling between different time zones, the patient should be advised to consult the physician, since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times.\nDue to the risk of precipitation in some pump catheters, Actrapid HM/Penfill should not be used in insulin pumps for continuous SC insulin infusion.\nActrapid contains metacresol which may cause allergic reactions.\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (eg, driving a car or operating machinery).\nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycemia while driving. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycemia. The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances.\nUse in Pregnancy and Lactation: There are no restrictions on the treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy, as insulin does not pass the placental barrier.\nIf untreated during pregnancy, diabetes mellitus constitutes a risk in intrauterine development. Diabetes therapy must therefore be continued during pregnancy. Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy, increase the risk of malformations and death in utero. Intensified blood glucose control and monitoring of pregnant women with diabetes are recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy.\nInsulin requirements usually fall in the 1st trimester and increase subsequently during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. After delivery, insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values.\nThere are no restrictions on treatment with Actrapid HM/Penfill during lactation. Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby. However, the insulin dosage, diet or both may need to be adjusted.",
      "adverse-reactions": "Adverse drug reactions observed in patients using Actrapid HM/Penfill are mainly dose-dependent and due to the pharmacologic effect of insulin. As for other insulin products, hypoglycemia, in general, is the most frequent adverse reactions. It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. The symptoms of hypoglycemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale skin, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in concentration, dizziness, hunger, blurred vision, headache, nausea and palpitation.\nIn clinical trials and during market use, the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens, therefore no specific frequency can be presented. Severe hypoglycemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. During clinical trials, the overall rates of hypoglycemia did not differ between patients treated with human insulin compared to insulin aspart.\nFrequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials, which by an overall judgment are considered related to Actrapid HM/Penfill are as follows. The frequencies are defined as: Uncommon (>1/1000, <1/100). Isolated spontaneous cases presented as very rare are defined as <1/10,000.\nImmune System Disorder: Uncommon: Urticaria, rash. Very Rare: Anaphylactic reactions. Symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity may include generalized skin rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic edema, difficulty in breathing, palpitation, reduction in blood pressure and fainting/loss of consciousness. Generalized hypersensitivity reactions are potentially life threatening.\nNervous System Disorder: Very Rare: Peripheral neuropathy. Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed \"acute painful neuropathy\", which is usually reversible.\nEye Disorders: Uncommon: Refraction disorders. Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy. These symptoms are usually of transitory nature. Very Rare: Diabetic retinopathy. Long-term improved glycemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Uncommon: Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area.\nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Uncommon: Injection site reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and hematoma at the injection site) may occur during treatment with insulin. Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment. Edema may occur upon initiation of insulin treatment. These symptoms are usually of transitory nature.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "A number of medicinal products are known to interact with the glucose metabolism.\nThe following substances may reduce the patient's insulin requirement: Oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), nonselective ß-blocking agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, salicylates, alcohol, anabolic steroids and sulfonamides.\nThe following substances may increase the patient's insulin requirement: Oral contraceptives, thiazides, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, ß-sympathomimetics and danazol.\nBeta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia and delay recovery from it.\nOctreotide/lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement.\nAlcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycemic effect of insulin.\nCombination of Thiazolidinediones with Insulin: Cases of congestive heart failure (Congestive heart failure) have been reported when thiazolidinediones were used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with risk factors for development of Congestive heart failure. This should be kept in mind if treatment with the combination of thiazolidinediones and insulin medicinal products is considered. If this combination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of Congestive heart failure, weight gain and edema. Thiazolidinediones should be discontinued if any symptom of deterioration in cardiac function occurs.",

      "mechanism": "Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Insulins and analogues, fast-acting, insulin (human). ATC Code: A10AB01.\nPharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: The blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin occurs when the molecules facilitate the uptake of glucose by binding to insulin receptors on muscle and fat cells, thus simultaneously inhibiting the output of glucose from the liver.\nActrapid HM/Penfill is a fast-acting insulin with an onset of action within ½ hr, reaching a maximum effect within 1.5-3.5 hrs and the duration of action is approximately 7-8 hrs.\nPharmacokinetics: Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes. Consequently, the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics. This process is influenced by several factors (eg, insulin dosage, injection route and site, thickness of SC fat, type of diabetes). The pharmacokinetics of insulin are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation.\nAbsorption: The maximum plasma concentration of insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hrs after SC administration.\nDistribution: No profound binding to plasma proteins, except circulating insulin antibodies (if present) has been observed.\nMetabolism: Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase. A number of cleavage (hydrolysis) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active.\nElimination: The terminal half-life (t½) is determined by the rate of absorption from the SC tissue. The t½ is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma (insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes). Trials have indicated a t½ of about 2-5 hrs.\nThe pharmacokinetic profile of Actrapid HM/Penfill has been studied in a small number (n=18) of diabetic children (6-12 years) and adolescents (13-17 years). The data are limited but suggest that the pharmacokinetic profile in children and adolescents may be similar to that in adults. However, there were differences between age groups in Cmax stressing the importance of individual dose titration.\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: Preclinical data reveal no specific hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.",

      "mechanism": "Microbiology: Antibacterial Spectrum: In vitro antibacterial activity of nadifloxacin showed a potent and broad spectrum against aerobic gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, including Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Acuatim activity is bactericidal. Nadifloxacin showed potent antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that was similar to the potency against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Acuatim was also active against new quinolone-resistant MRSA. Nadifloxacin was not cross-resistant with other new quinolones.\nIn vivo Antibacterial Activity: The in vivo therapeutic effect of Acuatim cream was superior to the cream base alone in experimental models of infections in mice which were subcutaneously infected with P. acnes and S. epidermidis.\nAntibacterial Effects: Results of follicular analysis obtained in clinical studies using acne patients indicated that Acuatim cream significantly decreased the counts of P. acnes and other microorganisms in the follicles, as compared to the control (cream base) treatment. Microbacterial tests were negative for Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, P. acnes and other microorganisms in 86.4% of the patients with folliculitis or sycosis vulgaris after the application of Acuatim cream. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of nadifloxacin against 394 clinical isolates of P. acnes, 76 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 45 of CNS and 24 of Staphylococcus aureus were not higher than 0.78, 0.39, 0.05 and 0.39 mcg/mL, respectively, evidencing its potent antibacterial activity. In addition, no resistance to nadifloxacin developed.\nMechanism of Action: Nadifloxacin showed an inhibitory effect on bacterial DNA gyrase activity (involved in DNA synthesis and replication) ie, converting relaxed DNA to supercoiled DNA.\nDevelopment of Resistance: The development of resistance after serial passage of nadifloxacin was rare as compared with that of other new quinolone antibacterial agents. The frequency of spontaneous mutants resistant to nadifloxacin was <10-8.\nPharmacokinetics: Following a single topical application of nadifloxacin 1% cream at 10 g to normal human back skin, the highest plasma concentration was determined to be 1.7 ng/mL with an elimination half-life of 19.4 hrs. Approximately 0.09% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine over 48 hrs post-dosing. The plasma concentration reached a steady state on day 5 of the repeated administration study when nadifloxacin 1% cream was administered at 5 g twice daily to normal healthy individuals for a period of 7 days. The plasma concentration reached a peak of 4.1 ng/mL at 8 hrs post-final dosing with an elimination half-life of 23.2 hrs. The urinary excretion rate reached 0.16% on day 7.\nClinical Studies: Clinical Efficacy: Nadifloxacin was studied in a total of 519 acne patients using both the open and double-blind test methods. Acuatim was applied to the face twice (morning and evening) daily after washing for 4 weeks. Efficacy (effective or markedly effective) was obtained in 67.1% (348/519) of the subjects.

      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Sodium hyaluronate has a covering and protective action to the cartilage surface of the joint, a suppressive action to the degenerative change in the cartilage tissue and an ameliorative action to the mobility range in articular contracture. It relieves pain in general arthrosis deformans, improves mobility range of the joints and normalizes synovial fluid.\nAction to the Cartilage of the Joint: Sodium hyaluronate was recognized to have entered into the surface layer of the cartilage by administration into the cavity of the knee joint of a normal rabbit. Moreover, in the cartilage of man with arthrosis deformans in the knee (in vitro), distribution of sodium hyaluronate extends widely from the surface layer into the entire layer of the cartilage with the progress of time. This distribution within the cartilage was in agreement with the parts deprived of proteoglycan. Separation of proteoglycan in the cells of articular cartilage of a cow is suppressed by sodium hyaluronate. Administration of sodium hyaluronate in the joint cavity of the knee using a rabbit as the model of arthrosis deformans of the knee and the model of fixed articular contracture of the knee, proved to have suppressed degeneration of cartilage.\nImprovement of Mobility Range of the Joints: In the model of fixed articular contracture using the rabbit, mobility range of the joint was improved by administration of sodium hyaluronate into articular cavity.\nToxicology: Nonclinical Tests: Acute Toxicity: LD50 value obtained when single administration was given intra-abdominally in male and female rats were 2014 and 1761 mg/kg, respectively.\nSubacute Toxicity: When repeated intra-abdominal administrations were given in rats during 28 days at a dose level of 30, 60, 120 and 240 mg/kg, the indifferent dose recognized was 30 mg/kg. Doses of >60 mg/kg caused a decrease of red blood cells (RBC) and total protein, which was recognized to be dose-dependent.

In a dose-ranging trial, at doses of 10 and 20 mg/day, somnolence was reported.\nSingle-daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist. In Aerius-treated subjects, there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9.2 bpm relative to placebo. The QT interval was corrected for heart rate (QTc) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods.\nUsing the QTc (Bazett), there was a mean increase of 8.1 msec in Aerius-treated subjects relative to placebo.\nUsing QTc (Fridericia), there was a mean increase of 0.4 msec in Aerius-treated subjects relative to placebo. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported.\nIn the event of overdose, consider standard measures to remove any unabsorbed drug. Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended.\nBased on a multiple-dose clinical trial in adults and adolescents, in which up to 45 mg of desloratadine was administered (9 times the clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.\nDesloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are not eliminated by hemodialysis; it is not known if it is eliminated by peritoneal dialysis.\nLethality occurred in rats at oral doses of =250 mg/kg (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 120 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose).

As there are no food effects on bioavailability, patients can be instructed that Aerius tablets may be taken without regard to meals. Patients should be advised not to increase the dose or the dosing frequency as studies have not demonstrated increased effectiveness at higher doses and somnolence may occur.\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: No effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been observed.\nCarcinogenicity, Mutagenicity and Impairment of Fertility: The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using loratadine studies. In an 18-month study in mice and a 2-year study in rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day in mice (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 3 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose) and 25 mg/kg/day in rats (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 30 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). Male mice given loratadine 40 mg/kg/day had a significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) than concurrent controls. In rats, a significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day and in males and females given 25 mg/kg/day. The estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures of rats given loratadine 10 mg/kg were approximately 7 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose. The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is not known. In genotoxicity studies with desloratadine, there was no evidence of genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation assay (Salmonella/E. coli mammalian microsome bacterial mutagenicity assay) or in 2 assays for chromosomal aberrations (human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenicity assay and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay).\nThere was no effect on female fertility in rats at desloratadine doses up to 24 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 130 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose).\nA male-specific decrease in fertility, demonstrated by reduced female conception rates, decreased sperm numbers and motility, and histopathologic testicular changes occurred at an oral desloratadine dose of 12 mg/kg in rats (estimated desloratadine exposures were approximately 45 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). Desloratadine had no effect on fertility in rats at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 8 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose).\nUse in pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C: Desloratadine was not teratogenic in rats at doses up to 48 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 210 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose) or in rabbits at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine exposures were approximately 230 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). In a separate study, an increase in pre-implantation loss and a decreased number of implantations and fetuses were noted in female rats at 24 mg/kg (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 120 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose).\nReduced body weight and slow righting reflex were reported in pups at doses of =9 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately =50 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). Desloratadine had no effect on pup development at an oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day (estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 7 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). No teratogenic or mutagenic effects were observed in animal trials with desloratadine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Since no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available with desloratadine, the safe use of Aerius during pregnancy has not been established. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, desloratadine should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\nUse in lactation: Desloratadine passes into breast milk, therefore, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue desloratadine, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\nUse in children: The safety and effectiveness of Aerius tablet in pediatric patients <12 years have not been established.\nEfficacy and safety of Aerius syrup in children <1 year have not been established.\nUse in the elderly: Clinical studies of desloratadine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects =65 years to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

      "adverse-reactions": "Allergic Rhinitis: In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials, 2834 patients received Aerius tablets at doses of 2.5-20 mg daily, of whom 1655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between Aerius- and placebo-treated patients. The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the Aerius group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events that were reported by =2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of Aerius tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with Aerius tablet than placebo, are listed in Table 5. (See Table 5.)\nThe frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in Aerius- and placebo-treated patients.\nThere were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age or race.\nChronic Idiopathic Urticaria: In multiple-dose, placebo-controlled trials of chronic idiopathic urticaria, 211 patients received Aerius tablets and 205 received placebo. Adverse events that were reported by =2% of patients who received Aerius tablets and that were more common with Aerius than placebo were (rates for Aerius and placebo, respectively): Headache (14%, 13%), nausea (5%, 2%), fatigue (5%, 1%), dizziness (4%, 3%), pharyngitis (3%, 2%), dyspepsia (3%, 1%) and myalgia (3%, 1%).\nThe following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine: Tachycardia, and rarely hypersensitivity reactions (eg, rash, pruritus, urticaria, edema, dyspnea and anaphylaxis), hepatitis and elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin.\nIn clinical trials in a pediatric population, Aerius syrup was administered to a total of 246 children 6 months to 11 years. The overall incidence of adverse events in children 2-11 years was similar for Aerius syrup and the placebo groups. In infants and toddlers 6-23 months, the most frequent adverse events reported in excess of placebo were diarrhea (3.7%), fever (2.3%) and insomnia (2.3%).\nIn clinical trials in a range of indications including seasonal allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily, undesirable effects with Aerius tablets were reported in 3% of patients in excess of those treated with placebo. The most frequent adverse events were reported in excess of placebo were fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%). Other undesirable effects reported very rarely during the post-marketing period are as follows: Cardiac Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitations, psychomotor hyperactivity, seizures.\nGastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, diarrhea.\nHepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatitis, elevations of liver enzymes, increased bilirubin.\nGeneral Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis, angioedema, pruritus, rash and urticaria).\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",

It has an empirical formula of C19H19ClN2 and a molecular weight of 310.8.\nDesloratadine is a white to off-white powder that is slightly soluble in water, but very soluble in ethanol and propylene glycol.",
      "mechanism": "Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Antihistamine-H1 antagonist. ATC Code: R06AX27.\nPharmacology: Mechanism of Action: Desloratadine is a non-sedating, long-acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective peripheral H1-receptor histamine antagonist activity. Receptor-binding data indicate that at a concentration of 2-3 ng/mL (7 nM), desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H1-receptor. Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro.\nResults of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H1-receptor-binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.\nAfter oral administration, desloratadine selectively blocks peripheral histamine H1-receptors because the substance is excluded from entry to the central nervous system. Desloratadine does not readily penetrate the central nervous system. At the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents, there was no excess incidence of somnolence as compared to placebo. Aerius tablets given at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg to adults and adolescents did not affect psychomotor performance in clinical trials. In a single-dose study performed in adults, desloratadine 5 mg did not affect standard measures of flight performance including exacerbation of subjective sleepiness or tasks related to flying.\nDesloratadine has demonstrated antiallergic properties from in vitro studies. These include inhibiting the release of proinflammatory cytokines eg, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells/basophils, as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule-P selection on endothelial cells. The clinical relevance of these observations remains to be confirmed.\nEfficacy of Aerius syrup has not been investigated in separate pediatric trials. Safety of Aerius syrup was demonstrated in 3 pediatric trials. Children 1-11 years who were candidates for antihistamine therapy received a daily dose of 1.25 mg (1-5 years) and 2.5 mg (6-11 years). Treatment was well tolerated as documented by clinical laboratory tests, vital signs and ECG internal data including QTc. When given at the recommended doses, the plasma concentration of desloratadine was comparable in the pediatric and adult populations. Thus, since the course of seasonal allergic rhinitis/chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadine are similar in adults and pediatric patients, desloratadine efficacy data in adults can be extrapolated to the pediatric population.\nIn a multiple dose clinical trial in adults and adolescents in which up to 20 mg of desloratadine was administered daily for 14 days, no statistically or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was observed in a clinical pharmacology trial in adults and adolescents, in which desloratadine was administered to adults at a dose of 45 mg daily (9 times the clinical dose) for 10 days, no prolongation of QTc interval was seen.\nPharmacodynamics: Wheal and Flare: Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5-mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hr; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hrs. There was no evidence of histamine-induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5-mg group over the 28-day treatment period.\nThe clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown.\nEffects on QTc: Single-dose administration of desloratadine did not alter the corrected QT interval (QTc) in rats (up to 12 mg/kg, oral), or guinea pigs (25 mg/kg, IV). Repeated oral administration at doses up to 24 mg/kg for durations up to 3 months in monkeys did not alter the QTc at an estimated desloratadine exposure (AUC) that was approximately 955 times the mean AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose. (See Overdosage for information on human QTc experience.)\nClinical Trials: Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis: The clinical efficacy and safety of Aerius tablets were evaluated in >2300 patients 12-75 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis. A total of 1838 patients received Aerius 2.5-20 mg/day in 4 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2- to 4-week duration conducted in the United States. The results of these studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Aerius 5 mg in the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In a dose ranging trial, Aerius 2.5-20 mg/day was studied. Doses of 5, 7.5, 10 and 20 mg/day were superior to placebo; and no additional benefit was seen at doses >5 mg. In the same study, an increase in the incidence of somnolence was observed at doses of 10 and 20 mg/day (5.2% and 7.6%, respectively), compared to placebo (2.3%).\nIn two 4-week studies of 924 patients (15-75 years) with seasonal allergic rhinitis and concomitant asthma, Aerius tablets 5 mg once daily improved rhinitis symptoms, with no decrease in pulmonary function. This supports the safety of administering Aerius tablets to adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis with mild to moderate asthma.\nAerius tablets 5 mg once daily significantly reduced the total symptom scores (the sum of individual scores of nasal and non-nasal symptoms) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (see Table 1).\nIn adult and adolescent patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms eg, sneezing, nasal discharge and itching, as well as ocular itching, tearing and redness and itching of palate. Aerius effectively controlled the symptoms for 24 hrs.\nThere were no significant differences in the effectiveness of Aerius tablets 5 mg across subgroups of patients defined by gender, age or race.\nAerius syrup was effective in alleviating the burden of seasonal allergic rhinitis as shown by the total score of the rhino conjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire. The greatest amelioration was seen in the domains of practical problems and daily activities limited by symptoms. Perennial Allergic Rhinitis: The clinical efficacy and safety of Aerius tablets 5 mg were evaluated in >1300 patients 12-80 years with perennial allergic rhinitis. A total of 685 patients received 5 mg/day of Aerius in 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 4-week duration conducted in the United States and internationally. In 1 of these studies, Aerius tablets 5 mg once daily was shown to significantly reduce symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis (see Table 2).\nChronic Idiopathic Urticaria: The efficacy and safety of Aerius tablets 5 mg once daily was studied in 416 chronic idiopathic urticaria patients 12-84 years, of whom 211 received Aerius. In 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of 6-week duration, at the prespecified 1-week primary time point evaluation, Aerius tablets significantly reduced the severity of pruritus when compared to placebo (see Table 3). Secondary endpoints were also evaluated and during the 1st week of therapy, Aerius tablets 5 mg reduced the secondary endpoints, \"number of hives\" and the \"size of the largest hive\", when compared to placebo. (See Table 3.)\nIn 2 placebo-controlled, 6-week trials in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in relieving pruritus and decreasing the size and number of hives by the end of the 1st dosing interval. In each trial, the effects were sustained over the 24-hr dosing interval. As with other antihistamine trials in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who were identified as non-responsive to antihistamines were excluded. An improvement in pruritus of >50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadine compared with 19% of patients treated with placebo. Treatment with Aerius also significantly reduced interference with sleep and daytime function, as measured by a 4-point scale used to assess these variables.\nPharmacokinetics: Absorption: Desloratadine plasma concentrations can be detected within 30 min of desloratadine administration in adults and adolescents. Following oral administration of desloratadine 5 mg once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers, the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations (Tmax) occurred at approximately 3 hrs post-dose and mean steady-state peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 4 ng/mL and 56.9 ng·hr/mL were observed, respectively. Desloratadine is well absorbed with a maximum concentration achieved after approximately 3 hrs; the terminal phase t½ is approximately 27 hrs. The degree of accumulation of desloratadine was consistent with its t½ (approximately 27 hrs) and a once-daily dosing frequency. The bioavailability of desloratadine was dose-proportional over the range of 5-20 mg. In a single-dose trial using a 7.5-mg dose of desloratadine, neither food (high-fat, high-caloric breakfast) nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability (Cmax and AUC) of desloratadine.\nDistribution: Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82-87% and 85-89%, moderately bound to plasma proteins, respectively. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function. There is no evidence of clinically relevant drug accumulation following once-daily adult and adolescent dosing of desloratadine (5-20 mg) for 14 days. In a single-dose, crossover study of desloratadine, the tablet and the syrup formulations were found to be bioequivalent.\nIn a separate single-dose study, at the recommended doses, pediatric patients had comparable AUC and Cmax values of desloratadine to those adults who received a 5-mg dose of desloratadine syrup.\nMetabolism: Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified yet, and therefore some interactions with other drugs can not be fully excluded. Studies conducted show that desloratadine does not inhibit CYP3A4 and is not a substrate or an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.\nData from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general patient population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are slow metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n=1087), approximately 7% of subjects were slow metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine <0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine t½ >50 hrs). The frequency of slow metabolizers is higher in Blacks (approximately 20% of Blacks were slow metabolizers in pharmacokinetic studies, n=276). The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the slow metabolizers was approximately 6-fold greater than the subjects who are not slow metabolizers. Subjects who are slow metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. Although not seen in these pharmacokinetic studies, patients who are slow metabolizers may be more susceptible to dose-related adverse events.\nElimination: The mean elimination t½ of desloratadine was 27 hrs. Cmax and AUC values increased in a dose-proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg. The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. A human mass balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87% of the 14C-desloratadine dose, which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products. Analysis of plasma 3-hydroxydesloratadine showed similar Tmax and t½ values compared to desloratadine.\nSpecial Populations: Elderly: In older subjects (65 years; n=17) following multiple-dose administration of Aerius tablets, the mean Cmax and AUC values for desloratadine were 20% greater than in younger subjects (<65 years). The oral total body clearance (CL/F) when normalized for body weight was similar between the 2 age groups. The mean plasma elimination t½ of desloratadine was 33.7 hrs in subjects 65 years. The pharmacokinetics for 3-hydroxydesloratadine appeared unchanged in older versus younger subjects. These age-related differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly subjects.\nRenally Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics following a single dose of 7.5 mg were characterized in patients with mild (n=7; creatinine clearance 51-69 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (n=6; creatinine clearance 34-43 mL/min/1.73 m2) and severe (n=6; creatinine clearance 5-29 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment or hemodialysis-dependent (n=6) patients. In patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, median Cmax and AUC values increased by approximately 1.2- and 1.9-fold, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function. In patients with severe renal impairment or who were hemodialysis-dependent, Cmax and AUC values increased by approximately 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Minimal changes in 3-hydroxydesloratadine concentrations were observed. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were poorly removed by hemodialysis. Plasma protein-binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered by renal impairment. Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended (see Dosage and Administration).\nHepatically Impaired: Desloratadine pharmacokinetics were characterized following a single oral dose in patients with mild (n=4), moderate (n=4) and severe (n=4) hepatic impairment as defined by the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic function and 8 subjects with normal hepatic function. Patients with hepatic impairment, regardless of severity, had approximately a 2.4-fold increase in AUC as compared with normal subjects. The apparent oral clearance of desloratadine in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was 37%, 36% and 28% of that in normal subjects, respectively. An increase in the mean elimination t½ of desloratadine in patients with hepatic impairment was observed. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine, the mean Cmax and AUC values for patients with hepatic impairment were not statistically and significantly different from subjects with normal hepatic function. Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended (see Dosage and Administration).\nGender: Female subjects treated for 14 days with Aerius tablets had 10% and 3% higher desloratadine Cmax and AUC values, respectively, compared with male subjects. The 3-hydroxydesloratadine Cmax and AUC values were also increased by 45% and 48%, respectively, in females compared with males.\nHowever, these apparent differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage adjustment is recommended.\nRace: Following 14 days of treatment with Aerius tablets, the Cmax and AUC values for desloratadine were 18% and 32% higher, respectively, in Blacks compared with Caucasians. For 3-hydroxydesloratadine, there was a corresponding 10% reduction in Cmax and AUC values in Blacks compared to Caucasians. These differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended.\nIn a pharmacokinetic trial in which patient demographics were comparable to those of the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of the subjects achieved a higher concentration of desloratadine. This percentage may vary according to ethnic background. Maximum desloratadine concentration was about 3-fold higher at approximately 7 hrs with a terminal phase (t½) of approximately 89 hrs. The safety profile of these subjects was not different from that of the general population.\nDrug Interactions: In 2 controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male (n=12 in each study) and female (n=12 in each study) volunteers, desloratadine 7.5 mg (1.5 times the daily dose) once daily was co-administered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hrs or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hrs for 10 days. In 3 separate controlled, parallel group clinical pharmacology studies, desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been co-administered with azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days (n=18) or with fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23-day pre-treatment period with fluoxetine (n=18) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hrs for 14 days (n=18) under steady-state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers. Although increased plasma concentrations (Cmax and AUC0-24 hrs) of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed (see Table 4), there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters (including the corrected QT interval), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs and adverse events.\nIn a clinical pharmacology trial in adults, co-administration with alcohol did not increase the alcohol-induced impairment in performance or increase in sleepiness. No significant differences were found in the psychomotor test results between desloratadine and placebo groups, whether administered alone or with alcohol.\nNo clinically relevant changes in desloratadine plasma concentrations were observed in multiple-dose ketoconazole and erythromycin interaction trials.\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: Desloratadine is the primary active metabolite of loratadine. Preclinical studies conducted with desloratadine and loratadine demonstrated that there are no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of desloratadine and loratadine at comparable levels of exposure to desloratadine.\nPreclinical data with desloratadine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction. The lack of carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in studies conducted with loratadine.",

Depression may follow rapid withdrawal.\nPerioperative acute hypertension can occur if volatile halogenated anaesthetics are used during treatment with indirect sympathomimetic agents. Therefore, if surgery is scheduled, it is preferable to discontinue treatment 24 hrs before anesthesia.\nAthletes should be informed that treatment with pseudoephedrine could lead to positive doping test.\nThe administration of Aerius D-12 should be discontinued at least 48 hrs before skin tests since antihistamines may prevent or reduce the other.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: There have been no reproduction studies conducted with the combination of desloratadine and pseudoephedrine.

Patients must also receive an IM injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week preceding the 1st dose of pemetrexed and once every 3 cycles thereafter. Subsequent vitamin B12 injections may be given on the same day as pemetrexed.\nMonitoring: Patients receiving pemetrexed should be monitored before each dose with a complete blood count, including a differential white cell count (WCC) and platelet count. Prior to each chemotherapy administration, blood chemistry tests should be collected to evaluate renal and hepatic function. Before the start of any cycle of chemotherapy, patients are required to have the following: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be =1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets should be =100,000 cells/mm3; CrCl should be =45 mL/min.\nThe total bilirubin should be =1.5 times upper limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be =3 times upper limit of normal. Alkaline phosphatase, AST and ALT =5 times upper limit of normal is acceptable if liver has tumour involvement.\nDose Adjustments: Dose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir haematologic counts or maximum non-haematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. Treatment may be delayed to allow sufficient time for recovery. Upon recovery, patients should be retreated using the guidelines in Tables 4, 5 and 6 (see Tables 4,5 and 6), which are applicable for Alimta used as a single agent or in combination with cisplatin. (See Tables 4.)\nIf patients develop non-haematologic toxicities =Grade 3 (excluding neurotoxicity), Alimta should be withheld until resolution to less than equal to the patient's pre-therapy value. Treatment should be resumed according to the guidelines in Table 5. (See Table 5.)\nIn the event of neurotoxicity, the recommended dose adjustment for Alimta and cisplatin is documented in Table 6. Patients should discontinue therapy if Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity is observed. (See Table 6.)\nTreatment with Alimta should be discontinued if a patient experiences any haematologic or non-haematologic Grade 3 or 4 toxicity after 2 dose reductions or immediately if Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity is observed.\nElderly: In clinical studies, there has been no indication that patients =65 years are at increased risk of adverse events compared to patients <65 years. No dose reductions other than those recommended for all patients are necessary.\nRenal Impairment (Standard Cockcroft and Gault formula or Glomerular Filtration Rate measured Tc99m-DPTA Serum Clearance Method): Pemetrexed is primarily eliminated unchanged by renal excretion. In clinical studies, patients with CrCl of =45 mL/min required no dose adjustments other than those recommended for all patients. There are insufficient data on the use of pemetrexed in patients with CrCl <45 mL/min. Therefore the use of pemetrexed is not recommended (see Precautions).\nHepatic Impairment: No relationships between AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), or total bilirubin and pemetrexed pharmacokinetics were identified. However, patients with hepatic impairment eg, bilirubin >1.5 times the upper limit of normal and/or aminotransaminase >3 times the upper limit of normal (hepatic metastases absent) or >5 times the upper limit of normal (hepatic metastases present) have not been specifically studied.\nAdministration: Alimta should be administered as an IV infusion over 10 min on the 1st day of each 21-day cycle. For instructions on reconstitution and dilution, see Cautions for Usage. (See Cautions for Usage.)",
      "over-dosage": "Reported symptoms of overdose include neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, mucositis, sensory polyneuropathy and rash. Anticipated complications of overdose include bone marrow suppression as manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia. In addition, infection with or without fever, diarrhoea, and/or mucositis may be seen.\nIn the event of suspected overdose, patients should be monitored with blood counts and should receive supportive therapy as necessary. The use of calcium folinate/folinic acid should be considered.",
      "contra-indications": "Hypersensitivity to pemetrexed or to any of the excipients of Alimta.\nConcomitant yellow fever vaccine (see Interactions).\nUse in lactation: It is not known whether pemetrexed is excreted in human milk and adverse reactions on the suckling child cannot be excluded. Breastfeeding must be discontinued during pemetrexed therapy.",
      "special-precautions": "Pemetrexed can suppress bone marrow function as manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia (or pancytopenia) (see Adverse Reactions). Myelosuppression is usually the dose-limiting toxicity. Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy and pemetrexed should not be given to patients until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) returns to =1,500 cells/mm3 and platelet count returns to =100,000 cells/mm3. Dose reductions for subsequent cycles are based on nadir ANC, platelet count and maximum non-haematologic toxicity seen from the previous cycle (see Dosage and Administration).\nLess toxicity and reduction in Grade 3/4 haematologic and non-haematologic toxicities eg, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3/4 neutropenia were reported when pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 was administered. Therefore all patients treated with pemetrexed must be instructed to take folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Dosage and Administration).\nSkin reactions have been reported in patients not pre-treated with a corticosteroid. Pre-treatment with dexamethasone (or equivalent) can reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions (see Dosage and Administration).\nAn insufficient number of patients has been studied with CrCl of <45 mL/min. Therefore, the use of pemetrexed in patients with CrCl of <45 mL/min is not recommended (see Dosage and Administration).\nPatients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl 45-79 mL/min) should avoid taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) eg, ibuprofen, aspirin (>1.3 g daily) for 2 days before, on the day of and 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see Interactions).\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency eligible for pemetrexed therapy NSAIDs with long elimination t½ should be interrupted for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, and at least 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see Interactions).\nSerious renal events, including acute renal failure, have been reported with pemetrexed alone or in association with other chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the patients in whom these occurred had underlying risk factors for the development of renal events including dehydration or preexisting hypertension or diabetes.\nThe effect of third space fluid, eg pleural effusion or ascites, on pemetrexed is not fully defined. A phase 2 study of pemetrexed in 31 solid tumour patients with stable 3rd space fluid demonstrated no difference in pemetrexed dose normalized plasma concentrations or clearance compared to patients without 3rd space fluid collections. Thus, drainage of 3rd space fluid collection prior to pemetrexed treatment should be considered, but may not be necessary.\nDue to the gastrointestinal toxicity of pemetrexed given in combination with cisplatin, severe dehydration has been observed. Therefore, patients should receive adequate antiemetic treatment and appropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving treatment.\nSerious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events have been uncommonly reported during clinical studies with pemetrexed, usually when given in combination with another cytotoxic agent. Most of the patients in whom these events have been observed had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors (see Adverse Reactions).\nImmunodepressed status is common in cancer patients. As a result, concomitant use of live attenuated vaccines is not recommended (see Contraindications and Interactions).\nCases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients treated with radiation either prior, during or subsequent to their pemetrexed therapy. Particular attention should be paid to these patients and caution exercised with use of other radiosensitising agents.\nCases of radiation recall have been reported in patients who received radiotherapy weeks or years previously.\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, it has been reported that pemetrexed may cause fatigue. Therefore, patients should be cautioned against driving or operating machines if this event occurs.\nImpairment of Fertility: Pemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Sexually mature males are advised not to father a child during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. Contraceptive measures or abstinence are recommended. Owing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men are advised to seek counseling on sperm storage before starting treatment.\nUse in pregnancy: There are no data from the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women but pemetrexed, like other anti-metabolites, is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see Pharmacology: Toxicology under Actions). Pemetrexed should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, after a careful consideration of the needs of the mother and the risk for the foetus.\nContraception in Males and Females: Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed. Pemetrexed can have genetically damaging effects. Sexually mature males are advised not to father a child during the treatment and up to 6 months thereafter. Contraceptive measures or abstinence are recommended.\nUse in children and adolescents: Alimta is not recommended for use in children <18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.",
      "adverse-reactions": "Summary of the Safety Profile: The most commonly reported adverse reactions related to pemetrexed, whether used as monotherapy or in combination, are bone marrow suppression manifested as anaemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal toxicities, manifested as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, pharyngitis, mucositis and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions include renal toxicities, increased aminotransferase, alopecia, fatigue, dehydration, rash, infection/sepsis and neuropathy. Rarely seen events include Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.\nTable 7 provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions that have been reported in >5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised to receive cisplatin and pemetrexed and 163 patients with mesothelioma randomised to receive the single agent cisplatin. In both treatment arms, these chemo-naive patients were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B12.\nFrequency Estimate: Very common (=1/10); common (=1/100 and <1/10); uncommon (=1/1000 and <1/100); rare (=1/10,000 and <1/1000); very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data-spontaneous reports).\nWithin each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. (See Table 7.)\nClinically relevant circular tumor cell (CTC) toxicities that were reported in =1% and =5% (common) of the patients that were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin and pemetrexed include: Renal failure, infection, pyrexia, febrile neutropenia, increased AST, ALT and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), urticaria and chest pain.\nClinically relevant CTC toxicities that were reported in <1% (uncommon) of the patients that were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin and pemetrexed include arrhythmia and motor neuropathy.\nTable 8 provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions that have been reported in >5% of 265 patients randomly assigned to receive single agent pemetrexed with folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation and 276 patients randomly assigned to receive single agent docetaxel. All patients were diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC and received prior chemotherapy. (See Table 8.)\nClinically relevant CTC toxicities that were reported in =1% and =5% (common) of the patients that were randomly assigned to pemetrexed include: Infection without neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, allergic reaction/hypersensitivity, increased creatinine, motor neuropathy, sensory neuropathy, erythema multiforme and abdominal pain.\nClinically relevant CTC toxicities that were reported in <1 % (uncommon) of the patients that were randomly assigned to pemetrexed include supraventricular arrhythmias.\nClinically relevant Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory toxicities were similar between integrated Phase 2 results from 3 single agent pemetrexed studies (n=164) and the phase 3 single agent pemetrexed study described in the previous text, with the exception of neutropenia (12.8% vs 5.3%, respectively) and ALT elevation (15.2% vs 1.9%, respectively). These differences were likely due to differences in the patient population, since the phase 2 studies included both chemo-naive and heavily pre-treated breast cancer patients with preexisting liver metastases and/or abnormal baseline liver function tests.\nThe table as follows provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions considered possibly related to study drug that have been reported in >5% of 839 patients with NSCLC who were randomized to receive cisplatin and pemetrexed and 830 patients with NSCLC who were randomized to receive cisplatin and gemcitabine. All patients received study therapy as initial treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC and patients in both treatment groups were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B12. (See Table 9.)\nClinically relevant toxicity that was reported in =1% and =5% of the patients that were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin and pemetrexed include: Increased AST and ALT, infection, febrile neutropenia, renal failure, pyrexia, dehydration, conjunctivitis and creatinine clearance decrease.\nClinically relevant toxicity that was reported in <1% of the patients that were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin and pemetrexed include: Increased GGT, chest pain, arrhythmia and motor neuropathy.\nClinically relevant toxicities with respect to gender were similar to the overall population in patients receiving pemetrexed plus cisplatin.\nTable 10 below provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions considered possibly related to study drug that have been reported in >5% of 800 patients randomly assigned to receive single agent pemetrexed and 402 patients randomly assigned to receive placebo in the single-agent pemetrexed maintenance (JMEN: N=663) and continuation pemetrexed maintenance (PARAMOUNT: N=539) studies. All patients were diagnosed with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and had received prior platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients in both study arms were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B12. (See Table 10.)\nClinically relevant CTC toxicity of any grade that was reported in =1% and =5% of the patients that were randomly assigned to pemetrexed include: Febrile neutropenia, infection, decreased platelets, decreased creatinine clearance, diarrhoea, constipation, edema, alopecia, increased creatinine, pruritis/itching, fever (in the absence of neutropenia), ocular surface disease (including conjunctivitis), increased lacrimation, decreased glomerular filtration rate, dizziness and motor neuropathy.\nClinically relevant CTC toxicity that was reported in <1% of the patients that were randomly assigned to pemetrexed include: Allergic reaction/hypersensitivity, erythema multiforme, renal failure, supraventricular arrhythmia and pulmonary embolism.\nSafety was assessed for patients who were randomised to receive pemetrexed (N=800). The incidence of adverse reactions was evaluated for patients who received =6 cycles of pemetrexed maintenance (N=568), and compared to patients who received >6 cycles of pemetrexed (N=232). Increases in adverse reactions (all grades) were observed with longer exposure. However, no statistically significant differences in any individual Grade 3/4/5 adverse reactions were seen.\nSerious cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, including myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, cerebrovascular accident and transient ischaemic attack have been uncommonly reported during clinical studies with pemetrexed, usually when given in combination with another cytotoxic agent. Most of the patients in whom these events have been observed had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors.\nRare cases of hepatitis, potentially serious, have been reported during clinical studies with pemetrexed.\nPancytopenia has been uncommonly reported during clinical trials with pemetrexed.\nIn clinical trials, cases of colitis (including intestinal and rectal bleeding, sometimes fatal, intestinal perforation, intestinal necrosis and typhlitis) have been reported uncommonly in patients treated with pemetrexed.\nIn clinical trials, cases of interstitial pneumonitis with respiratory insufficiency, sometimes fatal, have been reported uncommonly in patients treated with pemetrexed.\nUncommon cases of oedema have been reported in patients treated with pemetrexed.\nOesophagitis/radiation oesophagitis has been uncommonly reported during clinical trials with pemetrexed.\nSepsis, sometimes fatal, has been commonly reported during clinical trials with pemetrexed.\nDuring post-marketing surveillance, the following adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with pemetrexed: Blood and Lymphatic System: Rare cases of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia have been reported in patients treated with pemetrexed.\nUncommon cases of acute renal failure have been reported with pemetrexed alone or in association with other chemotherapeutic agents (see Precautions).\nUncommon cases of radiation pneumonitis have been reported in patients treated with radiation either prior, during or subsequent to their pemetrexed therapy (see Precautions).\nRare cases of radiation recall have been reported in patients who have received radiotherapy previously (see Precautions).\nUncommon cases of peripheral ischemia sometimes leading to extremity necrosis have been reported.\nRare cases of bullous conditions have been reported including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis which in some cases were fatal.\nRarely, haemolytic anaemia has been reported in patients treated with pemetrexed.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "Pemetrexed is mainly eliminated unchanged renally by tubular secretion and to a lesser extent by glomerular filtration. Concomitant administration of nephrotoxic drugs (eg, aminoglycoside, loop diuretics, platinum compounds, cyclosporin) could potentially result in delayed clearance of pemetrexed. This combination should be used with caution. If necessary, creatinine clearance should be closely monitored.\nConcomitant administration of substances that are also tubularly secreted (eg, probenecid, penicillin) could potentially result in delayed clearance of pemetrexed. Caution should be made when these drugs are combined with pemetrexed. If necessary, creatinine clearance should be closely monitored.\nIn patients with normal renal function (CrCl =80 mL/min), high doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs eg, ibuprofen >1,600 mg/day) and aspirin at higher dosage (=1.3 g daily) may decrease pemetrexed elimination and consequently, increase the occurrence of pemetrexed adverse events. Therefore, caution should be made when administering higher doses of NSAIDs or aspirin at higher dosage, concurrently with pemetrexed to patients with normal function (CrCl =80 mL/min).\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl 45-79 mL/min), the concomitant administration of pemetrexed with NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen) or aspirin at higher dosage should be avoided for 2 days before, on the day of and 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see Precautions).\nIn the absence of data regarding potential interaction with NSAIDs having longer t1/2 as piroxicam or rofecoxib, the concomitant administration with pemetrexed should be avoided for at least 5 days prior to, on the day and at least 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see Precautions).\nPemetrexed undergoes limited hepatic metabolism. Results from in vitro studies with human liver microsomes indicated that pemetrexed would not be predicted to cause clinically significant inhibition of the metabolic clearance of drugs metabolised by CYP3A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP1A2.\nInteractions Common to All Cytotoxics: Due to the increased thrombotic risk in patients with cancer, the use of anticoagulation treatment is frequent. The high intraindividual variability of the coagulation status during diseases and the possibility of interaction between oral anticoagulants and anticancer chemotherapy require increased frequency of international normalised ratio (INR) monitoring, if it is decided to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.\nConcomitant Use Contraindicated: Yellow Fever Vaccine: Risk of fatal generalised vaccinale disease (see Contraindications).\nConcomitant Use Not Recommended: Live Attenuated Vaccines (Except Yellow Fever, for which Concomitant Use is Contraindicated): Risk of systemic, possibly fatal, disease. The risk is increased in subjects who are already immunosuppressed by their underlying disease. Use an inactivated vaccine where it exists (poliomyelitis) (see Precautions).\nIncompatibilities: Pemetrexed is physically incompatible with diluents containing calcium, including lactated Ringer's Injection and Ringer's Injection. In the absence of compatibility studies, Alimta must not be mixed with other drugs.",
      "pregnancy-safe": "Category D: There is positive evidence of human foetal risk, but the benefits from use in pregnant women may be acceptable despite the risk (e.g., if the drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or for a serious disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective).\nCaution For Usage Special Precautions for Disposal and Other Handling: Use aseptic technique during the reconstitution and further dilution of pemetrexed for IV infusion administration. Calculate the dose and the number of Alimta vials needed. Each vial contains an excess of pemetrexed to facilitate delivery of label amount.\nAlimta 100 mg: Reconstitute 100 mg vials with 4.2 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection, without preservative, resulting in a solution containing pemetrexed 25 mg/mL. Gently swirl each vial until the powder is completely dissolved. The resulting solution is clear and ranges in colour from colourless to yellow or green-yellow without adversely affecting product quality. The pH of the reconstituted solution is between 6.6-7.8. Further dilution is required.\nAlimta 500 mg: Reconstitute 500 mg vials with 20 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, without preservative, resulting in a solution containing pemetrexed 25 mg/mL. Gently swirl each vial until the powder is completely dissolved. The resulting solution is clear and ranges in colour from colourless to yellow or green-yellow without adversely affecting product quality. The pH of the reconstituted solution is between 6.6-7.8. Further dilution is required.\nThe appropriate volume of reconstituted pemetrexed solution should be further diluted to 100 mL with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, without preservative and administered as an IV infusion over 10 min.\nPemetrexed infusion solutions prepared as directed are compatible with polyvinyl chloride and polyolefin lined administration sets and infusion bags. Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. If particulate matter is observed, do not administer. Pemetrexed solutions are for single use only. Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.\nPreparation and Administration Precautions: As with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, care should be exercised in the handling and preparation of pemetrexed infusion solutions. The use of gloves is recommended. If a pemetrexed solution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If pemetrexed solutions contact the mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. Pemetrexed is not a vesicant. There is no a specific antidote for extravasation of pemetrexed. There have been few reported cases of pemetrexed extravasation, which were not assessed as serious by the investigator. Extravasation should be managed by local standard practice as with other non-vesicants.",
      "storage": "Unopened Vial: Store below 25°C. Excursion permitted up to 30°C.\nShelf-Life: 2 years.\nReconstituted and Infusion Solutions: When prepared as directed, reconstituted and infusion solutions of Alimta contain no antimicrobial preservatives. Chemical and physical in-use stability of reconstituted and infusion solutions of pemetrexed were demonstrated for 24 hrs at refrigerated temperature. From a microbiological point of view, Alimta should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hrs at 2°-8°C, unless reconstitution/dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.",

      "mechanism": "Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Folic acid analogues. ATC Code: L01BA04.\nPharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: Pemetrexed is a multi-targeted anticancer antifolate agent that exerts its action by disrupting crucial folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication.\nIn vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multi-targeted antifolate by inhibiting thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), which are key folate-dependent enzymes for the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is rapidly and efficiently converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are even more potent inhibitors of TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumour cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells.\nClinical Efficacy: Mesothelioma: EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, single-blind phase 3 study of Alimta plus cisplatin versus cisplatin in chemo-naive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, has shown that patients treated with Alimta and cisplatin had a clinically meaningful 2.8-month median survival advantage over patients receiving cisplatin alone. During the study, low-dose folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation was introduced to patient therapy to reduce toxicity. The primary analysis of this study was performed on the population of all patients randomly assigned to a treatment arm who received the study drug (randomised and treated). A subgroup analysis was performed on patients who received folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation during the entire course of study therapy (fully supplemented). The results of these analyses of efficacy are summarised in Table 1. (See Table 1.)\nA statistically significant improvement of the clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnoea) associated with malignant pleural mesothelioma in the Alimta/cisplatin arm (212 patients) versus the cisplatin arm alone (218 patients) was demonstrated using the lung cancer symptom scale. Statistically significant differences in pulmonary function tests were also observed. The separation between the treatment arms was achieved by improvement in lung function in the Alimta/cisplatin arm and deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm.\nThere are limited data in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma treated with Alimta alone. Alimta at a dose of 500 mg/m2 was studied as a single-agent in 64 chemo-naive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. The overall response rate was 14.1%.\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) 2nd-Line Treatment: A multicentre, randomised, open-label phase 3 study of Alimta versus docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy has shown median survival times of 8.3 months for patients treated with Alimta [intent to treat population (ITT) n=283] and 7.9 months for patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n=288). An analysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on the treatment effect on overall survival was in favour of Alimta versus docetaxel for other than predominantly squamous histologies (n=399, 9.3 versus 8 months, adjusted HR=0.78; 95% CI=0.61-1, p=0.047) and was in favour of docetaxel for squamous cell carcinoma histology (n=172, 6.2 versus 7.4 months, adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=1.56; 95% CI=1.08-2.26, p=0.018). There were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of Alimta within the histology subgroups.\nLimited clinical data from a separate randomized, phase 3, controlled trial, suggest that efficacy data (overall survival, progression-free survival) for pemetrexed are similar between patients previously pre-treated with docetaxel (n=41) and patients who did not receive previous docetaxel treatment (n=540). (See Table 2.)\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer, 1st-Line Treatment: A multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study of Alimta plus cisplatin versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin in chemonaive patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIb or IV) NSCLC showed that Alimta plus cisplatin (ITT population n=862) met its primary endpoint and showed similar clinical efficacy as gemcitabine plus cisplatin (ITT n=863) in overall survival (adjusted HR 0.94; 95% CI=0.84-1.05). All patients included in this study had an eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1.\nThe primary efficacy analysis was based on the ITT population. Sensitivity analyses of main efficacy endpoints were also assessed on the protocol qualified (PQ) population. The efficacy analyses using PQ population are consistent with the analyses for the ITT population and support the non-inferiority of AC versus GC.\nProgression free survival (PFS) and overall response rate were similar between treatment arms: Median PFS was 4.8 months for Alimta plus cisplatin versus 5.1 months for gemcitabine plus cisplatin (adjusted HR 1.04; 95% CI=0.94-1.15) and overall response rate was 30.6% (95% CI = 27.3-33.9) for Alimta plus cisplatin versus 28.2% (95% CI=25-31.4) for gemcitabine plus cisplatin. Progression free survival data were partially confirmed by an independent review (400/1725 patients were randomly selected for review).\nThe analysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on overall survival demonstrated clinically relevant differences in survival according to histology is shown on table 3 and figure 1. (See Table 3 and Figure 1.)\nThere were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of Alimta plus cisplatin within the histology subgroups.\nPatients treated with Alimta and cisplatin required fewer transfusions (16.4% vs 28.9%, p<0.001), red blood cell transfusions (16.1% vs 27.3%, p<0.001) and platelet transfusions (1.8% vs 4.5%, p=0.002). Patients also required lower administration of erythropoietin/darbopoietin (10.4% vs 18.1%, p<0.001), G-CSF/GM-CSF (3.1% vs 6.1%, p=0.004) and iron preparations (4.3% versus 7.0%, p=0.021).\nNon-Small Lung Cell Cancer Maintenance Treatment: JMEN: A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study (JMEN), compared the efficacy and safety of maintenance treatment with Alimta plus best supportive care (BSC) (n=441) with that of placebo plus BSC (n=222) in patients with locally advanced (stage IIIB) or metastatic (stage IV) NSCLC who did not progress after 4 cycles of first-line doublet therapy containing cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or docetaxel. First-line doublet therapy containing Alimta was not included. All patients included in this study had an ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Patients received maintenance treatment until disease progression. Efficacy and safety were measured from the time of randomisation after completion of first-line (induction) therapy. Patients received a median of 5 cycles of maintenance treatment with Alimta and 3.5 cycles of placebo. A total of 213 patients (48.3%) completed =6 cycles and a total of 103 patients (23.4%) completed =10 cycles of treatment with Alimta.\nThe study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the Alimta arm over the placebo arm (n=581, independently reviewed population; median of 4 months and 2 months, respectively) (HR=0.6, 95% CI=0.49-0.73, p<0.00001). The independent review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator assessment of PFS. The median OS for the overall population (n=663) was 13.4 months for the Alimta arm and 10.6 months for the placebo arm, HR=0.79 (95% CI=0.65-0.95, p=0.01192).\nConsistent with other Alimta studies, a difference in efficacy according to NSCLC histology was observed in JMEN. For patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology (n=430, independently reviewed population) median PFS was 4.4 months for the Alimta arm and 1.8 months for the placebo arm, HR=0.47 (95% CI=0.37-0.60, p=0.00001). The median OS for patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology (n=481) was 15.5 months for the Alimta arm and 10.3 months for the placebo arm, HR=0.70 (95% CI=0.56-0.88, p=0.002). Including the induction phase, the median OS for patients with NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology was 18.6 months for the Alimta arm and 13.6 months for the placebo arm, HR=0.71 (95% CI=0.56-0.88, p=0.002).\nThe PFS and OS results in patients with squamous cell histology suggested no advantage for Alimta over placebo.\nThere were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of Alimta within the histology subgroups. (See Figure 2).\nParamount: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study (Paramount), compared the efficacy and safety of continuation maintenance treatment with Alimta plus best supportive care (BSC) (n=359) with that of placebo plus BSC (n=180) in patients with locally advanced (stage IIIB) or metastatic (stage IV) NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology which did not progress after 4 cycles of first-line doublet therapy of Alimta in combination with cisplatin. Of the 939 patients treated with Alimta plus cisplatin induction, 539 patients were randomized to maintenance treatment with pemetrexed or placebo. Of randomized patients, 44.9% had a complete/partial response and 51.9% had a response of stable disease to Alimta plus cisplatin induction. Patients randomized to maintenance treatment were required to have an ECOG performance status 0 or 1. The median time from the start of Alimta plus cisplatin induction therapy to the start of maintenance treatment was 2.96 months on both the pemetrexed arm and the placebo arm. Randomized patients received maintenance treatment until disease progression. Efficacy and safety were measured from the time of randomization after completion of first-line (induction) therapy. Patients received a median of 4 cycles of maintenance treatment with Alimta and 4 cycles of placebo. A total of 109 patients (30.4%) completed = 6 cycles maintenance treatment with Alimta, representing at least 10 cycles of Alimta.\nThe study met its primary endpoint and showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the Alimta arm over the placebo arm (n=472, independently reviewed population; media of 3.9 months and 2.6 months, respectively) (HR=0.64, 95% CI=0.51-0.81, p=0.0002), the independent review of patient scans confirmed the findings of the investigator assessment of PFS. For randomized patients, as measured from the start of Alimta plus cisplatin first-line induction treatment, the median investigator-assessed PFS was 6.9 months for the Alimta arm and 5.59 months for the placebo arm (HR= 0.59, 95% CI=0.47-0.74). A preliminary survival analysis showed that the median survival on the Alimta continuation arm after induction therapy with Alimta/cisplatin (4 cycles) was 13.9 months versus 11.1 months for those on the placebo arm (HR=0.78, 95% CI=0.60-0.98, p=0.034) at the time of this preliminary survival analysis, 48% of patients were alive on the Alimta arm versus 38% on the placebo arm, with a median follow-up of 11.04 months. (See Figure 3).\nPharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed following single-agent administration have been evaluated in 426 cancer patients with a variety of solid tumours at doses ranging from 0.2-838 mg/m2 infused over a 10-min period. Pemetrexed has a steady-state volume of distribution of 9 L/m2. In vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is approximately 81% bound to plasma proteins. Binding was not notably affected by varying degrees of renal impairment. Pemetrexed undergoes limited hepatic metabolism. Pemetrexed is primarily eliminated in the urine, with 70-90% of the administered dose being recovered unchanged in urine within the first 24 hrs following administration. Pemetrexed total systemic clearance is 91.8 mL/min and the elimination half-life (t1/2) from plasma is 3.5 hrs in patients with normal renal function [creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 90 mL/min]. Between patient variability in clearance is moderate at 19.3%. Pemetrexed total systemic exposure (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) increase proportionally with dose. The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed are consistent over multiple treatment cycles.\nThe pharmacokinetic properties of pemetrexed are not influenced by concurrently administered cisplatin. Oral folic acid and vitamin B12 IM supplementation do not affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed.\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: Administration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice resulted in decreased foetal viability and weight, incomplete ossification of some skeletal structures and cleft palate.\nAdministration of pemetrexed to male mice resulted in reproductive toxicity characterised by reduced fertility rates and testicular atrophy. In a study conducted in beagle dog by IV bolus injection for 9 months, testicular findings (degeneration/necrosis of the seminiferous epithelium) have been observed. This suggests that pemetrexed may impair male fertility. Female fertility was not investigated.\nPemetrexed was not mutagenic in either the in vitro chromosome aberration test in Chinese hamster ovary cells or the Ames test. Pemetrexed has been shown to be clastogenic in the in vivo micronucleus test in the mouse.\nStudies to assess the carcinogenic potential of pemetrexed have not been conducted.",

      "content": "Glimepiride",
      "indication": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled by diet, physical exercise and weight reduction alone. May be used in combination with metformin or insulin.",
      "dosage": "In principle, the dosage of Amaryl is governed by the desired blood sugar level. The dosage of glimepiride must be the lowest which is sufficient to achieve the desired metabolic control.\nTreatment with Amaryl must be initiated and monitored by a physician. Amaryl must be taken at the times and in the doses prescribed. Mistakes eg, forgetting to take a dose, must never be corrected by subsequently taking a larger dose. Measures for dealing with such mistakes (in particular, forgetting a dose or skipping a meal) or situations where a dose cannot be taken at the prescribed time must be discussed and agreed between physician and patient beforehand. A physician must be notified immediately if the dose taken is too high, or an extra dose has been taken.\nThe initial and the maintenance doses are set based on the results of regular checks of glucose in blood and urine. Monitoring of glucose levels in blood and urine also serves to detect either primary or secondary failure of therapy.\nInitial Dose and Dose Titration: Usual Initial Dose: 1 mg once daily. If necessary, the daily dose can be increased. Any increase should be based on regular blood sugar monitoring and should be gradual ie, at intervals of 1-2 weeks, and carried out stepwise, as follows: 1 mg - 2 mg - 3 mg - 4 mg and in exceptional cases, 8 mg.\nUsual Dose Range in Patients with Well-Controlled Diabetes: 1-4 mg daily. Only some patients benefit from daily doses of >6 mg.\nDistribution of Doses: Timing and distribution of doses are decided by the physician, taking into consideration the patient's current lifestyle. Normally, a single daily dose of Amaryl is sufficient. The dose should be taken immediately before a substantial breakfast or, if none is taken, immediately before the first main meal. It is very important not to skip meals after taking Amaryl.\nSecondary Dosage Adjustment: As the control of diabetes improves, sensitivity to insulin increases, therefore, glimepiride requirements may fall as treatment proceeds. To avoid an excessive reduction in blood sugar (hypoglycaemia), a timely dose reduction or cessation of Amaryl therapy must be considered.\nA dose adjustment must also be considered whenever the patient's weight or lifestyle changes, or other factors causing an increased susceptibility to hypoglycaemia or to an excessive increase in blood sugar levels (hyperglycaemia) arise (see Precautions).\nDuration of Treatment: Treatment with Amaryl is normally a long-term therapy.\nChangeover from Other Oral Antidiabetics to Amaryl: There is no exact dosage relationship between Amaryl and other oral blood sugar-lowering agents. When substituting Amaryl for other such agents, the initial daily dose is 1 mg; this applies even in changeovers from the maximum dose of another oral blood sugar-lowering agent. Any Amaryl dose increase should be in accordance with guidelines given previously in Initial Dose and Dose Titration.\nConsideration must be given to the potency and duration of action of the previous blood sugar-lowering agent. It may be necessary to interrupt treatment to avoid additive effects which would increase the risk of hypoglycaemia.\nUse in Combination with Metformin: Whenever blood sugar levels cannot be controlled adequately with the maximum daily dose of either Amaryl or a metformin-containing antidiabetic alone, both medicines may be used concomitantly. In such cases, the dose of the established medicine remains unchanged. Treatment with the additional medicine is started at a low dose which, depending on the desired blood sugar level, may then be increased gradually up to the maximum daily dose. Combined treatment should be initiated under close medical supervision.\nUse in Combination with Insulin: Whenever blood sugar levels cannot be controlled adequately with the maximum daily dose of Amaryl, insulin may be given concomitantly. In this case, the current dose of Amaryl remains unchanged. Insulin treatment is started at a low dose, which is subsequently increased stepwise according to the desired blood sugar level. Combined treatment should be initiated under close medical supervision.\nLong-term efficacy should be monitored by measurement of HbA1c levels eg, every 3-6 months.\nShort-term administration of Amaryl may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled well on diet and exercise.\nThere is limited information available on the use of Amaryl in renal insufficiency. Patients with impaired renal function may be more sensitive to the glucose-lowering effect of Amaryl.\nAdministration: Amaryl tablets must be swallowed without chewing and with sufficient amounts of liquid (approximately ½ glass).",
      "over-dosage": "Symptoms: Accidental or intentional overdose may cause severe and prolonged hypoglycaemia which may be life-threatening.\nTreatment: In case of overdosage with glimepiride, a physician must be notified immediately. At the 1st signs of hypoglycaemia, the patient must immediately take sugar, preferably glucose, unless a physician has already started care.\nSince hypoglycaemia and its clinical symptoms may recur after apparent clinical recovery (even after several days), close and continued medical supervision and possibly referral to a hospital are indicated. In particular, significant overdosage and severe reactions eg, with unconsciousness or other neurological dysfunctions, are emergency cases and require immediate care and hospitalization.\nIf hypoglycaemic coma is diagnosed or suspected, intravenous infusion of a 20% glucose solution (adults: 40-100 mL) is indicated. Alternatively, IV, SC or IM administration of glucagons (adults: 0.5-1 mg) may be considered. In infants, glucose must be dosed very carefully and close monitoring of blood glucose is required to minimize the risk of potentially severe hyperglycaemia. Other symptomatic therapy (eg, anticonvulsants) should be administered as necessary. After acute glucose replacement has been completed, it is usually necessary to give an IV glucose infusion in lower concentration so as to ensure that hypoglycaemia does not recur. The patient's blood glucose level should be carefully monitored for at least 24 hrs. In severe cases with a protracted course, hypoglycaemia, or the danger of slipping back into hypoglycaemia, may persist for several days.\nIn cases of acute intake of large amounts of glimepiride, detoxification (eg, by gastric lavage and administration of medicinal charcoal) is indicated.",
      "administration": "Should be taken with food: Take immediately before the 1st main meal of the day. Do not skip meals. Swallow whole, do not chew/crush.",
      "contra-indications": "Amaryl is not suitable for the treatment of insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus (eg, for the treatment of diabetics with a history of ketoacidosis), diabetic ketoacidosis or diabetic precoma or coma.\nAmaryl must not be used in patients hypersensitive to glimepiride, other sulfonylureas other sulfonamides or any of the excipients of Amaryl (see Description).\nNo experience has been gained concerning the use of Amaryl in patients with severe impairment of liver function and in dialysis patients. In patients with severe impairment of renal or hepatic function, a changeover to insulin is indicated, not least to achieve optimal metabolic control.\nUse in Pregnancy and Lactation: To avoid risk of harm to the child, Amaryl must not be taken during pregnancy; a changeover to insulin is necessary. Patients planning a pregnancy must inform their physician, and should changeover to insulin.\nIngestion of glimepiride with breast milk may harm the child. Therefore, Amaryl must not be taken by breastfeeding women and a changeover to insulin or discontinuation of breastfeeding is necessary.",
      "special-precautions": "To achieve optimal control of blood sugar, a correct diet, regular and sufficient physical exercise and if necessary, reduction of body weight are just as important as regular intake of Amaryl. Clinical signs of hyperglycaemia are increased urinary frequency, intense thirst, dryness of the mouth and dry skin.\nWhen starting treatment, the patient must be informed about the effects and risks of Amaryl and about its role in conjunction with dietary measures and physical exercise; the importance of adequate cooperation must also be stressed.\nIn the initial weeks of treatment, the risk of hypoglycaemia may be increased and necessitates especially careful monitoring. Factors favouring hypoglycaemia include: Unwillingness or (more commonly in older patients) incapacity of the patient to cooperate; undernutrition, irregular mealtimes or skipped meals; imbalance between physical exertion and carbohydrate intake; alterations of diet; consumption of alcohol, especially in combination with skipped meals; impaired renal function; severe impairment of liver function; overdosage with Amaryl; certain uncompensated disorders of the endocrine system affecting carbohydrate metabolism or counter-regulation of hypoglycaemia (eg, in certain disorders of thyroid function and in anterior pituitary or adrenocortical insufficiency); concurrent administration of certain other medicines (see Interactions).\nThe physician must be informed about such factors and about hypoglycaemic episodes, since these require particularly careful monitoring.\nIf such risk factors for hypoglycaemia are present, it may be necessary to adjust the dosage of Amaryl or the entire therapy. This also applies whenever illness occurs during therapy or the patient's lifestyle changes.\nThose symptoms of hypoglycaemia which reflect the body's adrenergic counter-regulation (see Adverse Reactions) may be milder or absent in those situations where hypoglycaemia develops gradually in the elderly and in patients with a certain type of nervous disease (autonomic neuropathy) or those receiving concurrent treatment with ß-blockers, clonidine, reserpine, guanethidine or other sympatholytic drugs.\nHypoglycaemia can almost always be promptly controlled by immediate intake of sugar eg, in the form of glucose, sugar cubes or sugar-sweetened beverages. Patients should always carry at least 20 g of glucose with them for this purpose (food or beverages containing artificial sweeteners eg, diet foods or drinks, are ineffective in controlling hypoglycaemia). They may require the assistance of other persons to avoid complications.\nIt is known from other sulfonylureas that, despite initially successful countermeasures, hypoglycaemia may recur. Therefore, continued close observation is necessary. Severe hypoglycaemia requires, in addition, immediate treatment and follow-up by a physician and, in some circumstances, hospitalization.\nIf treated by different physicians (eg, upon admission to hospital after an accident, illness while on holiday), the patients must inform them of their diabetic condition and previous treatment.\nIn exceptionally stressful situations (eg, trauma, surgery, infections with fever), blood sugar control may deteriorate and a temporary change to insulin may be necessary.\nDuring treatment with Amaryl, fasting glucose levels in blood and urine must be checked regularly, as should, additionally, the proportion of glycosylated haemoglobin. Usually every 3-6 months to more precisely assess long-term glycaemic control.\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: Alertness and reactions may be impaired due to hypo- or hyperglycaemia, especially when beginning or after altering treatment or when Amaryl is not taken regularly. Such impairment may for example, affect the ability to operate a vehicle or machinery.\nUse in Children: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.",
      "adverse-reactions": "Based on experience with Amaryl and on what is known of other sulfonylureas, the following adverse effects must be considered.\nHypoglycaemia: As a result of the blood sugar-lowering action of Amaryl, hypoglycaemia may occur and may also be prolonged.\nPossible symptoms of hypoglycaemia include headache, ravenous hunger, nausea, vomiting, lassitude, sleepiness, disordered sleep, restlessness, aggressiveness, impaired concentration, alertness and reactions, depression, confusion, difficulty in speaking and even speech loss, visual disorders, tremor, pareses, sensory disturbances, dizziness, helplessness, loss of self-control, delirium, cerebral convulsions, somnolence and loss of consciousness up to and including coma, shallow respiration and slow heart rate (bradycardia). In addition, signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be present eg, sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, rapid heart rate (tachycardia), hypertension, palpitations, angina pectoris and cardiac arrhythmias. The clinical picture of a severe hypoglycaemic attack may resemble that of a stroke. The symptoms of hypoglycaemia nearly always subside when hypoglycaemia is corrected.\nEyes: Especially at the start of treatment, temporary visual impairment may occur due to the change in blood sugar levels.\nDigestive Tract: Occasionally, gastrointestinal symptoms may occur eg, nausea, vomiting, sensations of pressure or fullness in the epigastrium, abdominal pain and diarrhoea.\nIn rare cases, liver enzyme levels may increase. In isolated cases, impairment of liver function (eg, with cholestasis and jaundice) and hepatitis may develop, leading to liver failure.\nBlood: Severe changes in blood picture may occur. Rarely, thrombopenia and in isolated cases, leucopenia, haemolytic anaemia or eg, erythrocytopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis and pancytopenia (eg, due to myelosuppression) may develop.\nOthers: Occasionally, allergic or pseudoallergic reactions may occur eg, itching, urticaria or rashes (eg, erythema, morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions), if skin reactions persist, Amaryl should be discontinued. Such reactions may be mild, but also may become more serious and may be accompanied by dyspnoea and a fall in blood pressure, sometimes progressing to shock. If urticaria occurs, a physician must be notified immediately.\nIn isolated cases, a decrease in serum sodium, inflammation of blood vessels (allergic vasculitis) and hypersensitivity of the skin to light may occur.\nConsult the physician if any of the adverse effects listed previously or any other undesired effects or unexpected changes occur.\nSince some adverse effects (eg, severe hypoglycaemia, certain changes in blood picture, severe allergic or pseudoallergic reactions or liver failure) may, under certain circumstances, become life-threatening, it is essential that, if sudden or severe reactions do occur, inform a physician at once and, on no account, continue taking the drug without a physician's express guidance.\nFurther to the previously mentioned adverse effects of Amaryl, the following events have been reported with sulfonylureas: Porphyria cutanea tarda, hepatic porphyria reaction, disulfiram-like reaction, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. It has been suggested that these sulfonylureas may augment the peripheral action of ADH and/or increase the release of ADH.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "Patients who take or discontinue taking certain other medicines while undergoing treatment with Amaryl may experience changes in blood sugar control.\nBased on experience with Amaryl and on what is known of other sulfonylureas, the following interactions must be considered: Potentiation of the blood sugar-lowering effect and thus, in some instances, hypoglycaemia may occur when one of the following medicines is taken eg, insulin and other oral antidiabetics, ACE inhibitors, allopurinol, anabolic steroids and male sex hormones, chloramphenicol, coumarin derivatives, cyclophosphamide, disopyramide, fenfluramine, fenyramidol, fibrates, fluoxetine, guanethidine, ifosfamide, MAO inhibitors, miconazole, fluconazole, para-aminosalicylic acid, pentoxifylline (high-dose parenteral), phenylbutazone, azapropazone, oxyphenbutazone, probenecid, quinolones, salicylates, sulfinpyrazone, clarithromycin, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, tritoqualine and trofosfamide.\nWeakening of the blood sugar-lowering effect and thus, raised blood sugar levels may occur when one of the following medicines is taken eg, acetazolamide, barbiturates, corticosteroids, diazoxide, diuretics, epinephrine (adrenaline) and other sympathomimetic agents, glucagon, laxatives (after protracted dose), nicotinic acid (in high doses), oestrogens and progestogens, phenothiazines, phenytoin, rifampicin and thyroid hormones.\nH2-Receptor antagonists, clonidine and reserpine may lead to either potentiation or weakening of the blood sugar-lowering effect.\nBeta-blockers decrease glucose tolerance. In patients with diabetes mellitus, this may lead to deterioration of metabolic control. In addition, ß-blockers may increase the tendency to hypoglycaemia (due to impaired counter-regulation).\nUnder the influence of sympatholytic drugs eg, ß-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation to hypoglycaemia may be reduced or absent.\nBoth acute and chronic alcohol intake may potentiate or weaken the blood sugar-lowering action of Amaryl unpredictably.\nThe effect of coumarin derivatives may be potentiated or weakened.",

      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea antidiabetic agent which decreases blood glucose concentrations. The primary mechanism of action of glimepiride appears to be dependent on stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic ß cells. Glimepiride acts in concert with glucose by improving the sensitivity of ß cells to physiological glucose stimulus, resulting in insulin secretion in the rhythim of meals. In addition, extrapancreatic effects (eg, reduction of basal hepatic glucose production and increased peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin and glucose uptake) may also play a limited role in the activity of glimepiride.\nIn nonfasting diabetic patients, the hypoglycaemic action of a single dose of glimepiride persist for 24 hrs.\nEvidence from in vitro and animal studies suggests that there is lower glucagon secretion with glimepiride than glibenclamide and this may give rise to a prolonged reduction of blood glucose levels without increased plasma insulin levels. The clinical significance of these findings is yet to be clarified. A long-term, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrated that Amaryl therapy improves postprandial insulin/C-peptide responses and overall glycaemic control without producing clinically meaningful increases in fasting insulin/C-peptide levels.\nThe efficacy of Amaryl is not affected by age, gender or weight. Amaryl therapy is effective in controlling blood glucose without deleterious changes in the plasma lipoprotein profile in patients. The physiological response to acute exercise (ie, reduction of insulin secretion) is still present during glimepiride therapy.",

      "indication": "As an adjunct to diet and exercise in patients with type II diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) when monotherapy with glimepiride or metformin do not result in adequate glycemic control; as replacement of glimepiride and metformin combination therapy.",
      "dosage": "Dosage should be individualized based on the patient's blood glucose levels. Generally, it should be recommended to initiate the lowest effective dose and increase the dose depending on the patient's blood glucose levels. Adequate monitoring of blood glucose levels should be performed.\nAmaryl M should be administered once or twice per day, before or with a meal.\nWhen switching from combination therapy of glimepiride plus metformin as separate tablets, Amaryl M should be administered on the basis of dosage currently being taken.",
      "over-dosage": "Because Amaryl M includes glimepiride, overdosage can produce hypoglycemia. Mild hypoglycemia without loss of consciousness or neurological findings should be treated aggressively with oral glucose and adjustments in drug dosage and/or meal patterns. Close monitoring should continue until the physician is assured that the patient is out of danger. Severe hypoglycemic reactions with coma, seizure or other neurological impairment occur infrequently, but constitute medical emergencies requiring immediate hospitalization. If hypoglycemic coma is diagnosed or suspected, the patient should be given a rapid IV injection of concentrated (50%) glucose solution. This should be followed by a continuous infusion of a more dilute (10%) glucose solution at a rate that maintain the blood glucose at a level >100 mg/dL. Patients should be closely monitored for a minimum of 24-48 hrs, because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery.\nBecause Amaryl M includes metformin, lactic acidosis may occur. Hypoglycemia has not been seen with ingestion of up to 85 g of metformin HCl. Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected.",
      "administration": "Should be taken with food: Take immediately before or together with meals.",
      "contra-indications": "Known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of Amaryl M, sulfonylureas, sulfonamides or biguanide.\nInsulin-dependent (type I) diabetes (eg, diabetics with a history of ketonemia), diabetic ketonemia, diabetic coma or precoma, acute or chronic metabolic acidosis.\nThere is no experience in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction or hemodialysis. In case of severe hepatic or renal function disorders, a change over to insulin is required to achieve adequate control of blood glucose.\nPatients susceptible or with a history of lactic acidosis, renal disease or dysfunction [eg, as suggested by serum creatinine levels =1.5 mg/dL (males), =1.4 mg/dL (females) or abnormal creatinine clearance], which may also result from conditions eg, cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction and septicemia.\nAmaryl M should be temporarily discontinued in patients being administered with iodinated contrast materials IV, because use of such products may result in acute alteration of renal function.\nSevere infections, before and after surgery, serious trauma.\nMalnourished, starving or debilitated patients, or patients with pituitary or adrenal insufficiency.\nHepatic dysfunction, severe lung dysfunction, other conditions likely to be with hypoxemia, excessive alcohol intake, dehydration, Gastrointestinal disturbances including diarrhea and vomiting.\nCongestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic treatment.\nUse in Pregnancy and Lactation: Amaryl M must not be taken during pregnancy. Otherwise there is risk of harm to the child. Pregnant patient or patient planning a pregnancy must inform the physician. It is recommended that such patients changeover to insulin.\nTo prevent possible ingestion with the breast milk and possible harm to the child, Amaryl M must not be taken by breastfeeding women. If necessary, the patient must change over to insulin or must stop breastfeeding.\nUse in Children: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Studies in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) have not been conducted.\nWarnings Lactic Acidosis: Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with Amaryl M. When it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiological conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia.\nLactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap and lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels >5 mcg/mL are generally found.\nThe reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin HCl is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patients-years with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patients-years). Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and medications.\nThe risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by the use of minimum effective dose of metformin. In addition, Amaryl M should be withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia or dehydration.\nBecause impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, Amaryl M should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking Amaryl M, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin HCl on lactate metabolism. In addition, Amaryl M should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radio-contrast study and for any surgical procedure.\nThe onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms eg, malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if these symptoms occur.\nSerum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, blood pH, lactate levels and blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of Amaryl M, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy with metformin, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of Gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\nLevels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but <5 mmol/L in patients taking Amaryl M do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms eg, poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity or technical problems in sample handling.\nLactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketouria and ketonemia).\nLactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis, Amaryl M intake should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin HCl is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery.\nIncreased Risk of Cardiovascular Mortality: The administration of oral hypoglycemic drug has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP) to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes.\nUGDP reported that patients treated for 5-8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 g/day) or phenformin (100 mg/day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality 2.5 times that of patients treated with diet alone and it resulted in discontinuation of the use of tolbutamide or phenformin. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the potential risks and benefits of glimepiride and of alternative modes of therapy.\nAlthough only 1 drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) and 1 drug in the biguanide class (phenformin), it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure.",
      "special-precautions": "Adequate blood glucose levels should be maintained concomitantly by diet and exercise, if necessary by weight loss as well as by taking Amaryl M regularly. Clinical signs of not adequately controlled blood glucose levels include oliguria, thirst, dipsia, dry skin, etc.\nPatients should be informed of the potential risks and advantage of Amaryl M. They should also be informed about the importance of adherence to dietary instructions and of a regular exercise program. It should be emphasized that patient's positive cooperation is important.\nHypoglycemia can almost always be promptly controlled by immediate intake of carbohydrates (glucose or sugar eg, lump sugar, fruit juice and tea including sugar, etc). Patients should carry approximately at least 20 g of sugar for this. Others help may be necessary to avoid complications. Artificial sweeteners have no effect.\nIt is known from other sulfonylureas that, despite initially successful countermeasures, hypoglycemia may recur. Patients must, therefore, remain under close observation. Severe hypoglycemia further requires immediate treatment and follow-up by a physician in some circumstances, inpatient hospital care.\nIf a patient receives a treatment from other physician or pharmacist (eg, hospitalization, accident, needed to see a doctor, etc), he should inform him of his current diabetic situation and previous treatment.\nIn exceptional stress-situations (eg, trauma, surgery, febrile infections) blood glucose regulation may deteriorate and a temporary change to insulin may be necessary to maintain good metabolic control.\nThe dosage of Amaryl M must be the lowest. Treatment requires regular monitoring of glucose levels in blood and urine. (In addition, determination of the proportion of glycosylated hemoglobin is recommended.) The effectiveness of therapy should be assessed and if not satisfactory, switch to another therapy should be promptly made.\nAlertness and reactions may be impaired due to hypo- or hyperglycemia, especially when beginning or after altering treatment or when Amaryl M is not taken regularly. This may affect the ability to drive or to operate machinery.\nMonitoring of Renal Function: Amaryl M is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Thus, patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for their age should not receive this drug. In patients with advanced age, Amaryl M should be carefully titrated to establish the minimum dose for adequate glycemic effect, because aging is associated with reduced renal function. In elderly patients, renal function should be monitored regularly and generally, Amaryl M should not be titrated to the maximum dose.\nUse of Concomitant Medications that may Affect Renal Function or Metformin Disposition: Concomitant medication(s) that may affect renal function or result in significant hemodynamic change or may interfere with the disposition of Amaryl M eg, cationic drugs that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion, should be used with caution.\nRadiologic studies involving the use of intravascular iodinated contrast materials (eg, IV urogram, IV cholangiography, angiography and computed tomography (CT) scans with contrast materials): Intravascular contrast studies iodinated materials can lead to acute alteration of renal function and have been associated with lactic acidosis in patients receiving this drug (see Contraindications). Therefore, in patients in whom any such study is planned, Amaryl M should be discontinued at the time of or prior to the procedure, and withheld for 48 hrs, subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been re-evaluated and found to be normal.\nHypoxic States: Cardiovascular collapse (shock) from whatever cause, acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction and other conditions characterized by hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause pre-renal azotemia. When such events occur in patients on Amaryl M therapy, the drug should be promptly discontinued.\nSurgical Procedures: Therapy should be temporarily suspended for any surgical procedure (except minor procedures not associated with restricted intake of food and fluids) and should not be restarted until the patient's oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal.\nAlcohol Intake: Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Therefore, patients should be warned against excessive acute or chronic alcohol intake while receiving Amaryl M.\nImpaired Hepatic Function: Since impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis, Amaryl M should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\nVitamin B12 Levels: A decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels without clinical manifestations, is observed in approximately 7% of patients receiving Amaryl M in controlled clinical trials of 29-weeks duration. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of this drug or vitamin B12 supplementation. Measurement of hematological parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on this drug and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12 measurements at 2- to 3-year intervals may be useful.\nChange in Clinical Status of Previously Controlled Diabetic: A diabetic patient previously well controlled on metformin HCl tablets who develops laboratory abnormalities or clinical illness (especially vague and poorly defined illness) should be evaluated promptly for evidence of ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis. Evaluation should include serum electrolytes and ketones, blood glucose and if indicated blood pH, lactate, pyruvate and metformin levels. If acidosis of either form occurs, this drug must be stopped immediately and other appropriate corrective measures initiated.\nInformation for Patients: Patients should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of Amaryl M and of alternative modes of therapy. They should also be informed about the importance of adherence to dietary instructions, of a regular exercise program, and of regular testing of blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, renal function and hematological parameters.\nThe risks of lactic acidosis, its symptoms and conditions that predispose to its development, as noted above and in the Warnings should be explained to patients. Patients should be advised to discontinue treatment immediately and to promptly notify their health practitioner, if unexplained hyperventilation, myalgia, malaise, unusual somnolence or other nonspecific symptoms occur. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of Amaryl M, Gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of Gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.\nPatients should be counseled against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, while receiving Amaryl M.\nMetformin alone does not usually cause hypoglycemia, although it may occur when metformin is used in conjunction with oral sulfonylureas. When initiating combination therapy, the risks of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment and conditions that predispose to its development should be explained to patients.\nSpecial Precautions: Careful monitoring should be required during the 1st week of treatment because of increased risk of hypoglycemia. The patients or conditions at risk of hypoglycemia are as follows: Unwillingness or incapacity of the patient to cooperate (more commonly in older patients); malnutrition, irregular mealtimes, skipped meals; imbalance between physical exertion and carbohydrate intake; alterations of diet; consumption of alcohol, especially in combination with skipped meals; impaired renal function; severe impairment of liver function; overdosage with Amaryl M; certain uncompensated disorders of the endocrine system (eg, disorders of thyroid function and in anterior pituitary or adrenocortical insufficiency) affecting carbohydrate metabolism or counter-regulation of hypoglycemia; concurrent administration of other certain medicines (see Interactions).\nIn these cases, close monitoring of blood glucose is necessary and patients should inform the physician or pharmacist of these factors and if they had symptoms of hypoglycemia. If such risk factors of hypoglycemia are present, it may be necessary to adjust the dosage of Amaryl M or the entire therapy. This also applies whenever illness occurs during therapy or the patient's lifestyle changes. Those symptoms of hypoglycemia which reflect the body's adrenergic counter-regulation (see Adverse Reactions) may be milder or absent where hypoglycemia develops gradually, in the elderly and where there is autonomic neuropathy or where the patient is receiving concurrent treatment with ß-blockers, clonidine, reserpine, guanethidine or other sympatholytic drugs.\nLaboratory Tests: Response to all diabetic therapies should be monitored by periodic measurements of fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels, with a goal of decreasing these levels toward the normal range. During initial dose titration, fasting glucose can be used to determine the therapeutic response. Therefore, both glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin should be monitored. Measurements of glycosylated hemoglobin may be especially useful for evaluating long-term control.\nPeriodic monitoring of hematological parameters (eg, hemoglobin/hematocrit and red blood cell indices) and renal function (serum creatinine) should be performed, at least on an annual basis. While megaloblastic anemia has rarely been seen with metformin therapy, if this is suspected, vitamin B12 deficiency should be excluded.\nDrug Abuse and Dependence: Metformin HCl product possesses no pharmacodynamic properties, either primary or secondary, which could be expected to result in abuse as a recreational drug or addiction.\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: Patients should be advised to drive or operate machinery with caution.\nCarcinogenicity, Mutagenicity and Impairment of Fertility: Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human daily dose on a body surface area basis. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats. However, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps was seen in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day.\nNo evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin was found in the Ames test (S. typhimurium), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), chromosomal aberration test (human lymphocytes), or in vivo micronuclei formation test (mouse bone marrow).\nFertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin administration at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day or approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human daily dose on a body surface area basis.\nUse in Elderly: Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and because the risk of serious adverse reactions to the drug is greater in patients with impaired renal function, it should only be used in patients with normal renal function. Because aging is associated with reduced renal function, metformin should be used with caution as age increases. Care should be taken in dose selection and should be based on careful and regular monitoring of renal function. Generally, elderly patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of metformin.",
      "adverse-reactions": "Glimepiride: Based on experience with Amaryl M and on what is known of other sulfonylureas, the following adverse reactions must be considered.\nHypoglycemia: As a result of the blood glucose-lowering action of Amaryl M, hypoglycemia may occur and may also be prolonged.\nPossible symptoms of hypoglycemia include headache, ravenous hunger, nausea, vomiting, lassitude, sleepiness, disordered sleep, restlessness, aggressiveness, impaired concentration, alertness and reactions, depression, confusion, speech disorders, aphasia, visual disorders, tremor, pareses, sensory disturbances, dizziness, helplessness, loss of self-control, delirium, cerebral convulsions, somnolence and loss of consciousness up to and including coma, shallow respiration and bradycardia. In addition, signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be present eg, sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, angina pectoris and cardiac arrhythmias.\nThe clinical picture of a severe hypoglycemic attack may resemble that of a stroke. The symptoms nearly always subside when hypoglycemia is corrected.\nEyes: Temporary visual impairment may occur due to the change in blood sugar levels especially at the start of treatment.\nDigestive Tract: Occasionally, Gastrointestinal symptoms eg, nausea, vomiting, sensations of pressure or fullness in the epigastrium, abdominal pain and diarrhea may occur.\nHepatobiliary: In cases, liver enzyme elevation and liver impairment (eg, cholestasis and jaundice) may occur, as well as hepatitis which may progress to liver failure.\nBlood: Changes in the blood picture may occur. Rarely, thrombopenia and in isolated cases, leucopenia, or hemolytic anemia, erythrocytopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis or pancytopenia may develop. Because it is reported that aplastic anemia and pancytopenia may occur in sulfonylureas, careful monitoring should be performed. If these occur, Amaryl M should be discontinued and adequate treatment taken.\nHypersensitivity: Occasionally, allergic or pseudoallergic reactions (eg, itching, urticaria or rashes) may occur. These reactions are almost mild but may develop into serious reactions with dyspnea and a fall in blood pressure, sometimes progressing to shock. In the event of urticaria, a physician must be notified immediately.\nOthers: In isolated cases, allergic vasculitis, skin hypersensitivity to light or a decrease in serum sodium concentration may occur.\nMetformin: Lactic Acidosis: See Warnings and Overdosage.\nHypoglycemia.\nGastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating, flatulence and anorexia) are the most common reactions to Amaryl M and are approximately 30% more frequent in patients on monotherapy than in placebo-treated patients, particularly during therapy initiation. These symptoms are generally transient and resolve spontaneously during continued treatment. Occasionally, temporary dose reduction may be useful. In clinical trials, Amaryl M was discontinued due to Gastrointestinal reactions in approximately 4% of patients.\nBecause Gastrointestinal symptoms during therapy initiation appear to be dose-related, they may be decreased by gradual dose escalation and by having patients take Amaryl M with meals.\nBecause significant diarrhea and/or vomiting may cause dehydration and prerenal azotemia, under such circumstances, Amaryl M should be temporarily discontinued.\nFor patients who have been stabilized on Amaryl M, nonspecific Gastrointestinal symptoms should not be attributed to therapy unless intercurrent illness or lactic acidosis has been excluded.\nSpecial Senses: During initiation of Amaryl M, approximately 3% of patients may complain of an unpleasant or metallic taste which usually resolve spontaneously.\nDermatologic Reactions: Rash, etc may occur. In this case, Amaryl M should be discontinued.\nHematological: Rarely, anemia, leukocytopenia or thrombocytopenia may occur.\nApproximately 9% of patients on Amaryl M monotherapy and 6% of patients on Amaryl M/sulfonylurea combination therapy developed asymptomatic subnormal serum vitamin B12 levels; serum folic acid levels did not decrease significantly. However, only megaloblastic anemia have been reported with Amaryl M administration and no increased incidence of neuropathy has been observed. Therefore, serum B12 levels should be appropriately monitored or periodic parenteral B12 supplementation considered.\nHepatic: Occasionally, impaired hepatic function may occur.\nIf the previously mentioned adverse reactions, other undesirable reactions or unexpected changes may occur, patients should promptly notify the physician. Certain adverse reactions including severe hypoglycemia, special hematological change, severe allergic or pseudoallergic reactions and hepatic insufficiency may be life-threatening in certain conditions, and if these reactions occur, patients should promptly inform the physician and stop taking Amaryl M until physician's instructions.\nIn local phase 1 and open phase 3 clinical trials, unexpected adverse reactions of Amaryl M except for those of glimepiride and metformin already known have not been observed.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "Glimepiride: When other drugs are concomitantly administered to or withdrawn from a patient receiving this drug, both undesired increases and decreases in the hypoglycemic action of glimepiride can occur. Based on experience with this drug and with other sulfonylureas, the following interactions must be considered:\nGlimepiride is metabolized by cytochrome P-450 2C9 (CYP2C9). Its metabolism is known to be influenced by concomitant administration of CYP2C9 inducers (eg, rifampicin) or inhibitors (eg, fluconazole).\nDrugs potentiating the blood glucose-lowering effect: Insulin and oral antidiabetic products, ACE inhibitors, allopurinol, anabolic steroids, male sex hormones, chloramphenicol, coumarin anticoagulants, cyclophosphamide, disopyramide, fenfluramine, fenyramidol, fibrates, fluoxetine, guanethidine, ifosfamide, MAO inhibitors, miconazole, fluconazole, para-aminosalicylic acid, pentoxifylline (high-dose parenteral), phenylbutazone, probenecid, quinolone antibiotics, salicylates, sulfinpyrazone, sulfonamide, tetracyclines, tritoqualine, trofosfamide, azapropazone, oxyphenbutazone.\nDrugs weakening the blood glucose-lowering effect: Acetazolamide, barbiturates, corticosteroids, diazoxide, diuretics, epinephrine (adrenaline) or sympathomimetics, glucagons, laxatives (long-term use), nicotinic acid (high dose), estrogens, progestogens, phenothiazines, phenytoin, rifampicin, thyroid hormones.\nDrugs either potentiating or weakening the blood glucose-lowering effect: H2-antagonists, clonidine, reserpine.\nBeta-blockers reduce glucose tolerance. Reduction of glucose tolerance may change metabolic control. Beta-blockers may increase the risk of hypoglycemia (due to failure of counter-regulation).\nDrugs reducing or blocking the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation to hypoglycemia: Sympatholytic drugs (eg, ß-blockers), clonidine, guanethidine, reserpine.\nBoth acute and chronic alcohol intake may potentiate or weaken the blood glucose-lowering action of this drug in an unpredictable fashion.\nThis drug may either potentiate or weaken the effects of coumarin derivatives.\nMetformin: Lactic acidosis may occur by concomitant administration of the following drugs. When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be closely monitored: Iodinated contrast materials, antibiotics having strong nephrotoxicity (gentamicin, etc).\nThe hypoglycemic action of co-administration with the following drugs may be potentiated or weakened. When these drugs are administered, the blood glucose level and patient should be observed closely.\nDrugs Potentiating the Effect: Insulin, sulfonamides and sulfonylureas products, anabolic steroids, guanethidine, salicylates (aspirin, etc), ß-blockers (propranolol, etc), MAO inhibitors.\nDrugs Weakening the Effect: Epinephrine, corticosteroids, thyroid hormones, estrogens, diuretics, pyrazinamide, isoniazid, nicotinic acid, phenothiazines.\nGlyburide: In a single-dose interaction study in type 2 diabetes subjects, co-administration of metformin and glyburide did not result in any changes on either metformin pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Decrease in glyburide AUC and Cmax were observed, but were highly variable. The single-dose nature of this study and the lack of correlation between glyburide blood levels and pharmacodynamic effects, makes the clinical significance of this interaction uncertain.\nFurosemide: A single-dose metformin-furosemide drug interaction study in healthy subjects demonstrated that pharmacokinetic parameters of both compounds were affected by co-administration. Furosemide increased the metformin plasma and blood Cmax by 22% and blood AUC by 15% without any significant change in metformin renal clearance. When administered with metformin, the Cmax and AUC of furosemide were 31% and 12% smaller, respectively, than when administered alone, and the terminal half-life was decreased by 32% without any significant change in furosemide renal clearance. No information is available about the interaction of metformin and furosemide when co-administered chronically.\nNifedipine: A single-dose, metformin-nifedipine drug interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that co-administration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC by 20% and 9% respectively, and increased the amount excreted in the urine. Metformin had minimal effects on nifedipine.\nCationic Drugs: Cationic drugs (eg, amiloride, digoxin, morphine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, ranitidine, triamterene, trimethoprim and vancomycin) that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion theoretically have the potential for interaction with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. Such interaction between metformin and oral cimetidine has been observed in normal healthy volunteers in both single- and multiple-dose metformin-cimetidine drug interaction studies, with a 60% increase in peak metformin plasma and whole blood concentrations and a 40% increase in plasma and whole blood metformin AUC. There was no change in elimination t½ in the single-dose study. Metformin had no effect on cimetidine pharmacokinetics. Although such interactions remain theoretical (except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of metformin and/or the interfering drug is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via the proximal renal tubular secretory system.\nOthers: Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycaemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. These drugs include thiazide and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel-blocking drugs and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving metformin, the patient should be closely observed to maintain adequate glycemic control.\nIn healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of metformin and propranolol and metformin and ibuprofen were not affected when co-administered in single-dose interaction studies.\nMetformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs eg, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol and probenecid as compared to the sulfonylureas, which are extensively bound to serum proteins.",

      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Glimepiride is a blood sugar-lowering agent belonging to the sulfonylurea group. The decrease in blood sugar is achieved principally by means of the stimulation of insulin release from pancreatic ß-cells. This effect is predominantly based on improved responsiveness of these cells to the physiological glucose stimulus. Glimepiride augments the normal action of insulin on peripheral glucose uptake. Moreover, it mimics such action as well as the glucose output of the liver. Good metabolic control over 24 hrs can be achieved with a single dose of Amaryl M.\nIn patients with insufficient response to the maximum dose, combined use with an additional oral antidiabetic containing metformin or with insulin improves metabolic control.\nMetformin is a blood sugar-lowering agent belonging to the biguanide group. The decrease in blood sugar is achieved principally by not increasing insulin secretion. Moreover, metformin is not metabolized in the liver; excretion is through urine and feces.",

Changes in amlodipine plasma concentrations are not correlated with the degree of renal impairment. Amlodipine may be used in such patients at normal doses. Amlodipine is not dialyzable.\nCongestive Heart Failure: In general, calcium-channel blockers should be used with caution in patients with heart failure.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: Safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy or lactation has not been established. Amlodipine does not demonstrate toxicity in animal reproductive studies other than to delay parturition and prolong labor in rats at a dose level 50 times the maximum recommended dose in humans. Accordingly, use in pregnancy and lactation is recommended only when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk for the mother and fetus.\nUse in the elderly: The time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and younger subjects. Amlodipine clearance tends to be decreased with resulting increases in area under the curve (AUC) and elimination half-life in elderly patients.

      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: Amlodipine is a calcium ion-influx inhibitor (slow channel blocker or calcium-ion antagonist) and inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscles.\nThe mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle. The precise mechanism by which amlodipine relieves angina has not been fully determined but amlodipine reduces the total ischemic burden by the following 2 actions: Amlodipine dilates peripheral arterioles and thus, reduces the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works. Since the heart rate remains stable, this unloading of the heart reduces myocardial energy consumption and oxygen requirements.\nThe mechanism of action of amlodipine also probably involves dilatation of the main coronary arteries and coronary arterioles, both in normal and ischemic regions. This dilatation increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients with coronary artery spasm (prinzmetal's or variant angina).\nIn patients with hypertension, once a day dosing provides clinically significant reductions of blood pressure in both the supine and standing positions throughout the 24-hr interval. Due to the slow onset of action, acute hypotension is not a feature of amlodipine administration.\nIn patients with angina, once a day administration of amlodipine increases total exercise time, time to angina onset and time to 1 mm ST segment depression and decreases both angina attack frequency and nitroglycerine tablet consumption.\nIn vitro studies have shown that approximately 97.5% of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins. Amlodipine has not been associated with any adverse metabolic effect or change in plasma lipids and is suitable for use in patients with asthma, diabetes and gout.\nPharmacokinetic studies with cyclosporin have demonstrated that amlodipine does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporin.\nHemodynamic studies and exercise-based controlled clinical trial in NYHA Class II-IV heart failure patients have shown that amlodipine did not lead to clinical deterioration as measured by exercise tolerance, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and clinical symptomatology.\nA placebo-controlled study (PRAISE) designed to evaluate patients with NYHA Class II-IV heart failure receiving digoxin, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has shown that amlodipine did not lead to an increase risk of mortality or combined mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure. In the same study, in a group of patients without clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of underlying ischemic disease, a clinically and statistically significant reductions in mortality and combined mortality and morbidity was observed with amlodipine.\nPharmacokinetics: Absorption: After oral administration of therapeutic doses, amlodipine is well absorbed with peak blood levels between 6-12 hrs post-dose. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64% and 80%. The volume of distribution is approximately 21 L/kg. Absorption of amlodipine is unaffected by consumption of food.\nBiotransformation/Elimination: The terminal plasma elimination half-life is about 35-50 hrs and is consistent with once-daily dosing. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after 7-8 days of consecutive dosing. Amlodipine is extensively metabolized by the liver to inactive metabolites with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of metabolites excreted in the urine.",

      "mechanism": "Amiparen is a new formula of total amino acid solution intended for use in hyperalimentation and general parenteral nutrition.\nAmiparen contains relatively larger amounts of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine), which suppress protein breakdown and promote protein synthesis in muscle tissue, and smaller amounts of aromatic and acidic amino acids. A series of preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that Amiparen was effective in sparing protein under various types of insults and malnutritional state.\nAmiparen is also formulated to contain no chloride ions and minimum sodium ions to facilitate easy supplementation of electrolytes.\nPharmacology: The value of Amiparen as a source of amino acids in nutritional support was assessed in hyperalimentation therapy using normal rats and insulted rats.\nAmiparen promptly improved and maintained nitrogen balance, and exhibited a pronounced nitrogen-sparing effect in these models.\nThe solution promoted synthesis of plasma total protein and albumin.\nThe urinary 3-methylhistidine/creatinine ratio, an indicator of protein catabolism in the muscle under insult, was low after infusion treatment, indicating a very potent inhibitory effect of the solution on muscle protein breakdown.\nPlasma concentrations of free amino acids, including branched-chain amino acids, showed minor fluctuation during infusion treatment. Amino acid metabolism was judged to be steady during Amiparen therapy.\nClinical Studies: Clinical studies of Amiparen were conducted in a total of 546 patients undergoing central or peripheral venous nutritional management.\nThese studies provided evidence of the high clinical value of Amiparen as a source of amino acids in terms of major protein metabolism-related indices, including nitrogen balance, serum total protein and albumin levels, rapid protein turnover, and urinary 3-methylhistidine/creatinine ratio.\nAdverse Reactions and Abnormal Laboratory Values: In 546 treated patients, 17 cases of side effects were reported. Complaints included vascular pain (0.4%), nausea and vomiting (0.4%). Abnormal laboratory tests showed an increase in SGOT and/or SGPT (0.7%), an increase in BUN (0.5%) and an increase in total bilirubin (0.4%).\nPharmacokinetics: 14C-amino acids formulated in Amiparen were readily taken up into plasma protein fractions after IV infusion in normal rats at 3, 7 and 57 weeks of age. The radioactivity was distributed in higher concentrations to protein fractions of the spleen, liver and kidneys, as well as the muscles.\nRespiratory excretion accounted for 37.1-44.2% over 72 hrs post-infusion.\nAs other major routes of elimination, 3.9-5.2% and 1.2-3.1% of the radioactivity were recovered from the urine and feces, respectively.\nAmino acid fractions in the urine contained only 1.1-1.5% of the amino acids given. The overall retention of amino acids in the body amounted to >98.5% of the dose.\nToxicology: Acute Toxicity: LD50 values (IV, infusion rate: 4 mL/min): 107 mL/kg male rabbits, 120 mL/kg female rabbits.\nLong-Term Toxicity Studies (Rabbits, IV, 13 and 26 Weeks): An antigenicity study and a local irritation study did not reveal any Amiparen-related specific toxic symptoms.",

      "indication": "Treatment of adult patients and children =8 years with diabetes mellitus.",
      "dosage": "Apidra is a recombinant human insulin analogue that has been shown to be equipotent to regular human insulin. It has more rapid onset and a shorter duration of action than regular human insulin.\nApidra should be given shortly (0-15 min) before or soon after meals. It should be used in regimens that include a longer-acting insulin or basal insulin analogue and can be used with oral hypoglycemic agents. The dosage of Apidra should be individually adjusted.\nAdministration: Apidra should be given by SC injection or by continuous SC pump infusion. Apidra should be administered SC in the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or by continuous infusion in the abdominal wall. As for all insulins, injection and infusion sites within an injection area (abdomen, thigh or deltoid) should be rotated from one injection to the next. As for all insulins, the rate of absorption and consequently, the onset and duration of action, may be affected by the injection site, exercise and other variables.\nSubcutaneous injection in the abdominal wall ensures a slightly faster absorption than other injection sites. Care should be taken to ensure that blood vessel has not been entered. After administration, the site of injection should not be massaged. Patients must be educated to use proper injection techniques.\nMixing with Insulins: Apidra must not be mixed with any preparation other than Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) human insulin. If Apidra is mixed with NPH human insulin, Apidra should be drawn into the syringe first. Injection should be given immediately after mixing. No data are available on mixing insulin glulisine with insulin preparations other than NPH human insulin.\nContinuous Subcutaneous Infusion Pump: Apidra may be used for Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) in pump systems suitable for insulin.\nSpecial Populations: Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetic properties of insulin glulisine are generally maintained in patients with renal impairment. However, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions).\nHepatic Impairment: The pharmacokinetic properties of insulin glulisine have not been investigated in patients with decreased liver function. In patients with hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.\nElderly: Limited pharmacokinetic data are available in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus. Deterioration of renal function may lead to a decrease in insulin requirements.\nChildren and Adolescents: There is no adequate clinical information on the use of Apidra in children and adolescents.",
      "over-dosage": "Hypoglycemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin activity relative to food intake and energy expenditure.\nThere are no specific data available concerning overdose with insulin glulisine. However, hypoglycemia may develop over sequential stages: Mild hypoglycemia episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products. It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patient constantly carries sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice.\nSevere hypoglycemia episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated by glucagon (0.5-1 mg) given IM or SC by a person who has received appropriate instruction, or by glucose given IV by a medical professional.\nGlucose must also be given IV, if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10-15 min. Upon regaining consciousness, administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse.\nAfter an injection of glucagon, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to find the reason for this severe hypoglycemia and prevent other similar episodes.",
      "administration": "Should be taken with food: Administer w/in 15 min before a meal or immediately after a meal.",

      "special-precautions": "Transferring a patient to a new type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision. Changes in strength, brand [manufacturer, type (regular, NPH, lente, etc), species/animal] and/or method of manufacturing may result in a change in dosage.\nConcomitant oral antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted. The use of inadequate dosages or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-dependent diabetic, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, conditions which are potentially lethal.\nHypoglycemia: The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the action profile of the insulins used and may, therefore, change when the treatment regimen is changed. Conditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia different or less pronounced include long duration of diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, diabetic nerve disease, medicinal products eg, ß-blockers or after transfer from animal-source insulin to human insulin. Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activiy or change their usual meal plan. Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. When compared with soluble human insulin, if hypoglycemia occurs after an injection with rapid-acting analogues, it may occur earlier. Uncorrected hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness, coma or death. Insulin requirements may be altered during illness or emotional disturbances.\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia or for example, as a result of visual impairment.\nThis may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (eg, driving a car or operating machinery). Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycemia whilst driving. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycemia. The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances.\nUse in Pregnancy: There are no adequate data on the use of insulin glulisine in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin glulisine and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonal/fetal development, parturition or postnatal development.\nPreclinical data did not reveal toxicity findings other than those linked to the blood glucose-lowering pharmacodynamic activity (hypoglycemia), different from regular human insulin or of clinical relevance for humans. Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women.\nCareful monitoring of glucose control is essential. It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control throughout pregnancy. Insulin requirement may decrease during the 1st trimester and generally increase during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters.\nImmediately after delivery, insulin requirements decline rapidly.\nUse in Lactation: It is unknown whether insulin glulisine is excreted in human milk, but in general, insulin does not pass into breast milk and is not absorbed after oral administration. Breastfeeding mothers may require adjustments in insulin dose and diet.",

Symptoms of hypoglycemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation.\nHypoglycemia can become severe and may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death.\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Common: Injection site and local hypersensitivity reactions.\nLocal hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling and itching at the injection site) may occur during treatment with insulin. These reactions are usually transitory and normally disappear during continued treatment.\nRare: Lipodystrophy. It may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area.\nGeneral Disorders: Uncommon: Systemic hypersensitivity reactions may include uticaria, chest tightness, dyspnea, allergic dermatitis and pruritus. Severe cases of generalized allergy, including anaphylactic reaction, may be life-threatening.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of insulin glulisine and particularly, close monitoring.\nSubstances that may enhance the blood glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to hypoglycemia include oral antidiabetic agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.\nSubstances that may reduce the blood glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic agents (eg, epinephrine, adrenaline, salbutamol, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, estrogens, progestins (eg, oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medication (eg, olanzapine and clozapine).\nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may potentiate or weaken the blood glucose-lowering activity of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia, which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia.

      "mechanism": "Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Insulin and analogues, fast-acting. ATC Code: A10AB06.\nPharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: Insulin glulisine is a recombinant human insulin analogue that is equipotent to regular human insulin. Insulin glulisine has more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of action than regular human insulin. The primary activity of insulins and insulin analogues, including human insulin glulisine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulins lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lypolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis.\nStudies in healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that insulin glulisine is more rapid in onset of action and of shorter duration of action than regular human insulin when given subcutaneously. When insulin glulisine is injected subcutaneously, the glucose-lowering activity will begin within 10-20 min. The glucose-lowering activities of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin are equipotent when administered by IV route. One unit of insulin glulisine has the same glucose-lowering activity as one unit of regular human insulin.\nA phase I study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus assessed the glucose-lowering profiles of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.15 u/kg at different times in relation to a 15-min standard meal. Data indicated that insulin glulisine administered 2 min before the meal gives similar postprandial glycemic control compared to regular insulin given 30 min before the meal. When given 2 min prior to meal, insulin glulisine provided better postprandial control than regular human insulin given 2 min before the meal. Insulin glulisine administered 15 min after starting the meal gives similar glycemic control as regular human insulin given 2 min before the meal.\nObesity: A phase I study carried out with insulin glulisine, lispro and regular human insulin in an obese population has demonstrated that insulin glulisine maintains its rapid-acting properties.\nIn this study, the time to 20% of total AUC and the AUC (0-2 hrs) representing the early glucose-lowering activity were 144 min and 427 mg/kg for insulin glulisine, 121 min and 354 mg/kg for lispro, 150 min and 197 mg/kg for regular human insulin.\nClinical Studies: Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: In a 26-week, phase III clinical study comparing insulin glulisine with insulin lispro both injected subcutaneously shortly (0-15 min) before a meal in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus using insulin glargine as basal insulin, insulin glulisine was comparable to insulin lispro for glycemic control as reflected by changes in glycated hemoglobin (expressed as HbA1c equivalent) from baseline to endpoint. Comparable self-monitored blood glucose values were observed. No increase in the basal insulin dose was needed with insulin glulisine, in contrast to insulin lispro.\nA 12-week, phase III clinical study performed in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus receiving insulin glargine as basal therapy indicate that the immediate postmeal administration of insulin glulisine provides efficacy that was comparable to immediate premeal insulin glulisine (0-15 min) or regular insulin (30-45 min).\nIn the per-protocol population, there was a significantly larger observed reduction in GHb in the premeal glulisine group compared with the regular insulin group.\nType 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A 26-week, phase III clinical study followed by a 26-week extension safety study was conducted to compare insulin glulisine (0-15 min before a meal) with regular human insulin (30-45 min before a meal) injected subcutaneously in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus also using NPH insulin as basal insulin. The average body mass index (BMI) of patients was 34.55 kg/m2.\nInsulin glulisine was shown to be comparable to regular human insulin with regard to glycated hemoglobin (expressed as HbA1c equivalent) changes from baseline to the 6-month endpoint (-0.46% for insulin glulisine and -0.3% for regular human insulin, p=0.0029) and from baseline to the 12-month endpoint (-0.23% for insulin glulisine and -0.13% for regular human insulin, difference is not significant). In this study, the majority of patients (79%) mixed their short-acting insulin with NPH insulin immediately prior to injection and 58% of subjects used oral hypoglycemic agents at randomization and were instructed to continue to use them at the same dose.\nRace and Gender: In controlled clinical trials in adults, insulin glulisine did not show differences in safety and efficacy in subgroup analyses based on race and gender.\nPharmacokinetics: In insulin glulisine, the replacement of the human insulin amino acid, asparagine, in position B3 by lysine and the lysine in position B29 by glutamic acid favors more rapid absorption.\nAbsorption and Bioavailability: Pharmacokinetic profiles in healthy volunteers and diabetes patients (type 1 or 2) demonstrated that absorption of insulin glulisine was about twice as fast with peak concentration approximately twice as high as compared to regular human insulin.\nIn a study in patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of 0.15 u/kg for insulin glulisine, the Tmax was 55 min and Cmax was 82±1.3 IU/mL compared to a Tmax of 82 min and a Cmax of 46±1.3 IU/mL for regular human insulin. The mean residence time of insulin glulisine was shorter (98 min) than for regular human insulin (161 min).\nIn the study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after subcutaneous administration of insulin glulisine 0.2 u/kg, the Cmax was 91 microunit/mL with the interquartile range from 78-104 microunit/mL.\nWhen insulin glulisine was injected subcutaneously into the abdomen, deltoid and thigh, the concentration-time profiles were similar with slightly faster absorption when administered in the abdomen compared to the thigh. Absorption from deltoid sited was in-between (see Dosage and Administration). The absolute bioavailability (70%) of insulin glulisine was similar between injection sites and of low intra-subject variability (11% CV).\nDistribution and Elimination: The distribution and elimination of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin after IV administration is similar with volumes of distribution of 13 L and 22 L and half-lives of 13 and 18 min, respectively. After SC administration, insulin glulisine is eliminated more rapidly than regular human insulin with an apparent half-life of 42 min compared to 85 min.\nIn an across study analysis of insulin glulisine in either healthy subjects or subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, the apparent t½ ranged from 37-75 min (interquartile range).\nSpecial Population: Renal Impairment: In a clinical study performed in non-diabetic subjects covering a wide range of renal function (CrCl >80 mL/min, 30-50 mL/min, <30 mL/min), the rapid-acting properties of insulin glulisine were generally maintained. However, insulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment.\nHepatic Impairment: The pharmacokinetic properties have not been investigated in patients with impaired liver function.\nElderly: Very limited pharmacokinetic data are available for elderly patients with diabetes mellitus.\nChildren and Adolescents: The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of insulin glulisine were investigated in children (7-11 years) and adolescents (12-16 years) with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Insulin glulisine was rapidly absorbed in both age groups, with similar Tmax and Cmax as in adults (see Dosage and Administration).\nAdministered immediately before a test meal, insulin glulisine provided better postprandial control than regular human insulin, as in adults (see Pharmacodynamics).\nThe glucose excursion (AUC 0-6 hrs) was 641 mg/dL for insulin glulisine and 801 mg/dL for regular human insulin.\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: Preclinical data did not reveal toxicity findings other than those linked to the blood glucose-lowering pharmacodynamic activity (hypoglcemia), different from regular human insulin or of clinical relevance for humans.",

Aprovel, at a dose of 150 mg once daily generally provides a better 24-hr blood pressure control than 75 mg. However, initiation of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly in haemodialysed patients and in the elderly >75 years.\nIn patients insufficiently controlled with 150 mg once daily, the dose can be increased to 300 mg or other antihypertensive agents can be added. In particular, the addition of a diuretic eg, hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive effect with Aprovel (see Interactions).\nHypertensive Type 2 Diabetic Patients: Therapy should be initiated at irbesartan 150 mg once daily and titrated up to 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease.\nThe demonstration of renal benefit of Aprovel in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is based on studies where irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to reach target blood pressure (see Pharmacology under Actions).\nIntravascular Volume Depletion: Volume- and/or sodium-depletion should be corrected prior to administration of Aprovel.\nChildren: The safety and efficacy of Aprovel have not been established in children.\nElderly: Although considerations should be given to initiating therapy with 75 mg in patients >75 years, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary for the elderly.\nRenal Impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower starting dose (75 mg) should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis.\nHepatic Impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment.",

No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Aprovel.\nThe patient should be closely monitored and the treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdosage. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis.",
      "administration": "May be taken with or without food.",
      "contra-indications": "Hypersensitivity to any component of Aprovel (see Description).\nSecond and third trimester of pregnancy (see Precautions).\nLactation (see Precautions).\nFertility: Irbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing the first signs of parental toxicity (see Pharmacology: Toxicology: Preclinical Safety Data under Actions).\nUse in Pregnancy: The use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see Precautions). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see Precautions).\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however, a small increase in risk cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.\nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see Pharmacology: Toxicology:Preclinical Safety Data under Actions).\nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see Contraindications and Precautions).\nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see Precautions).\nUse in Lactation: Because no information is available regarding the use of Aprovel during breast-feeding, Aprovel is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.",
      "special-precautions": "Intravascular Volume Depletion: Symptomatic hypotension, especially after the 1st dose, may occur in patients who are volume- and/or sodium-depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Aprovel.\nRenovascular Hypertension: There is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. While this is not documented with Aprovel, a similar effect should be anticipated with angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\nRenal Impairment and Kidney Transplantation: When Aprovel is used in patients with impaired renal function, a periodic monitoring of potassium and creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration of Aprovel in patients with a recent kidney transplantation.\nHypertensive Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Renal Disease: The effects of irbesartan both on renal and cardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study with patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and non-white subjects (see Pharmacology under Actions).\nHyperkalemia: As with other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, hyperkalemia may occur during the treatment with Aprovel, especially in the presence of renal impairment, overt protenuria due to diabetic renal disease and/or heart failure. Close monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see Interactions).\nLithium: The combination of lithium and Aprovel is not recommended (see Interactions).\nAortic and Mitral Valve Stenosis, Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: As with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\nPrimary Aldosteronism: Patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive drugs acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Therefore, the use of Aprovel is not recommended.\nGeneral: In patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (eg, patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria or rarely, acute renal failure. As with any antihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke.\nAs observed for ACE inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin antagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in Black people than in non-Blacks, possibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the Black hypertensive population (see Pharmacology under Actions).\nLactose: Aprovel contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: The effects of irbesartan on the ability to drive and use machines has not been studied, but based on its pharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely to affect this ability. When driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment.\nUse in Pregnancy: Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative should be started (see Contraindications).\nUse in Children: Irbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations aged 6 to 16 years old but the current data are insufficient to support an extension of the use in children until further data become available (see Pharmacology: Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics under Actions and Adverse Reactions).",
      "adverse-reactions": "In placebo-controlled trials in patients with hypertension, the overall incidence of adverse events did not differ between the irbesartan (56.2%) and the placebo groups (56.5%). Discontinuation due to any clinical or laboratory adverse events was less frequent for irbesartan-treated patients (3.3%) than for placebo-treated patients (4.5%). The incidence of adverse events was not related to dose (in the recommended dose range), gender, age, race, or duration of treatment.\nIn diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, orthostatic dizziness and orthostatic hypotension were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i.e. uncommon) but in excess of placebo.\nThe following table presents the adverse drug reactions that were reported in placebo-controlled trials in which 1,965 hypertensive patients received irbesartan.

Uncommon: Chest pain.\nInvestigation: Very common: Hyperkalaemia* occurred more often in diabetic patients treated with irbesartan than with placebo.\nIn diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria and normal renal function, hyperkalaemia (=5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4% of the patients in the irbesartan 300 mg group and 22% of the patients in the placebo group. In diabetic hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria, hyperkalemia (=5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3% of the patients in the irbesartan group and 26.3% of the patients in the placebo group.\nCommon: Significant increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7%) in irbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with identifiable clinical musculoskeletal events.\nIn 1.7% of hypertensive patients with advanced diabetic renal disease treated with irbesartan, a decrease in haemoglobin*, which was not clinically significant, has been observed.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "Diuretics and Other Antihypertensive Agents: Other antihypertensive agents may increase the hypotensive effects of irbesartan; however, Aprovel has been safely administered with other antihypertensive agents eg, ß-blockers, long-acting calcium-channel blockers and thiazide diuretics. Prior treatment with high-dose diuretics may result in volume-depletion and a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with Aprovel (see Precautions).\nPotassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: Based on experience with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other drugs that may increase serum potassium levels (eg, heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and is, therefore, not recommended (see Precautions).\nLithium: Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with ACE inhibitors. Similar effects have been rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination is not recommended (see Precautions). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.\nNonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): When angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs [ie, selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (>3 g/day) and nonselective NSAIDs], attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.\nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure and an increase in serum potassium, especially in patients with poor preexisting renal function. The combination should be administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and periodically thereafter.\nAdditional Information on Drug Interactions: In clinical studies, the pharmacokinetics of irbesartan is not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolized by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when irbesartan was co-administered with warfarin, a drug metabolized by CYP2C9.\nThe effects of CYP2C9 inducers eg, rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of irbesartan have not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetics of digoxin was not altered by co-administration of irbesartan.",

      "mechanism": "Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Angiotensin II receptor antagonist. ATC Code: C09CA04.\nPharmacology: Irbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist.\nMechanism of Action: It is expected to block all actions of angiotensin II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source or route of synthesis of angiotensin II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin II (AT1) receptors results in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin II levels, and a decrease in plasma aldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at the recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (kininase II)], an enzyme which generates angiotensin II and also degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its activity.\nClinical Efficacy: Hypertension: Irbesartan lowers blood pressure with minimal change in heart rate. The decrease in blood pressure is dose-related for once-a-day doses with a tendency towards plateau at doses >300 mg. Doses of 150-300 mg once daily lower supine or seated blood pressures at trough (ie, 24 hrs after dosing) by an average of 8-13/5-8 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) greater than those associated with placebo.\nPeak reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 3-6 hrs after administration and the blood pressure-lowering effect is maintained for at least 24 hrs. At 24 hrs, the reduction of blood pressure was 60-70% of the corresponding peak diastolic and systolic responses at the recommended doses. Once-daily dosing with 150 mg produced trough and mean 24-hr responses similar to twice-daily dosing on the same total dose.\nThe blood pressure-lowering effect of Aprovel is evident within 1-2 weeks, with the maximal effect occurring by 4-6 weeks after start of therapy. The antihypertensive effects are maintained during long-term therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, blood pressure gradually returns toward baseline. Rebound hypertension has not been observed.\nThe blood pressure-lowering effects of irbesartan and thiazide-type diuretics are additive. In patients not adequately controlled by irbesartan alone, the addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily results in a further placebo-adjusted blood pressure reduction at trough of 7-10/3-6 mmHg (systolic/diastolic).\nThe efficacy of Aprovel is not influenced by age or gender. As is the case with other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, Black hypertensive patients have notably less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (eg, 12.5 mg daily), the antihypertensive response in Black patients approaches that of White patients.\nThere is no clinically important effect on serum uric acid or urinary uric acid secretion.\nHypertension and Type 2 Diabetes with Renal Disease: The \"Irbesartan Diabetic Neuropathy Trial (IDNT)\" shows that irbesartan decreases the progression of renal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and overt proteinuria. IDNT was a double-blind, controlled, morbidity and mortality trial comparing Aprovel, amlodipine and placebo. In 1715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria =900 mg/day and serum creatinine ranging from 1-3 mg/dL, the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of Aprovel on the progression of renal disease and all-cause mortality were examined. Patients were titrated from 75 mg to a maintenance dose of Aprovel 300 mg, from amlodipine 2.5 mg to 10 mg, or placebo as tolerated.\nPatients in all treatment groups typically received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive agents (eg, diuretics, ß-blockers, a-blockers) to reach a predefined blood pressure goal of =135/85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic pressure if baseline was >160 mmHg. Sixty percent (60%) of patients in the placebo groups reached this target blood pressure whereas this figure was 76% and 78% in the irbesartan and amlodipine groups respectively. Irbesartan significantly reduced and relative risk in the primary combined endpoint of doubling serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or all-cause mortality. Approximately 33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached the primary renal composite endpoint compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine groups [20% relative risk versus placebo (p=0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction compared to amlodipine (p=0.006)]. When the individual components of the primary endpoint were analysed, no effect in all cause mortality was observed, while a positive trend in the reduction in ESRD and a significant reduction in doubling of serum creatinine were observed.\nSubgroups consisting of gender, race, age, duration of diabetes, baseline blood pressure, serum creatinine and albumin excretion rate were assessed for treatment effect. In the female and Black subgroups which represented 32% and 26% of the overall study population respectively, a renal benefit was not evident, although the confidence intervals do not exclude it. As for the secondary endpoint of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the 3 groups in the overall population, although an increased incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) was seen for women and a decreased incidence of nonfatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebo-based regimen. An increased incidence of nonfatal MI and stroke was seen in females in the irbesartan-based regimen versus the amlodipine-based regimen, while hospitalization due to heart failure was reduced in the overall population. However, no proper explanation for these findings in women has been identified.\nThe study of the \"Effect of Irbesartan on Microalbuminuria in Hypertensive Patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (IRMA 2)\" shows that irbesartan 300 mg delays progression to overt proteinuria in patients with microalbuminuria. IRMA 2 was a placebo-controlled double-blind morbidity study in 590 patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day) and normal renal function (serum creatinine =1.5 mg/dL in males and <1.1 mg/dL in females).\nThe study examined the long-term effects (2 years) of Aprovel on the progression to clinical (overt) proteinuria [urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) >300 mg/day and an increase in UAER of at least 30% from baseline].\nThe predefined blood pressure goal was =135/85 mmHg. Additional antihypertensive agents (excluding ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium blockers) were added as needed to help achieve the blood pressure goal.\nWhile similar blood pressure was achieved in all treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the placebo (14.9%) or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, demonstrating a 70% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p=0.0004) for the higher dose. An accompanying improvement in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not observed during the first 3 months of treatment. The slowing in the progression to clinical proteinuria was evident as early as 3 months and continued over the 2-year period. Regression to normal albuminuria (<30 mg daily) was more frequent in the Aprovel 300 mg group (34%) than in the placebo group (21%).\nPharmacokinetics: After oral administration, irbesartan is well absorbed; studies of absolute bioavailability gave values of approximately 60-80%. Concomitant food intake does not significantly influence the bioavailability of irbesartan.\nPlasma protein-binding is approximately 96%, with negligible binding to cellular blood components. The volume of distribution is 53-93 L.\nFollowing oral or IV administration of 14C-irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating plasma radioactivity is attributable to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolized by the liver via glucuronide conjugation and oxidation. The major circulating metabolite is irbesartan glucuronide (approximately 6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily oxidised by the cytochrome P-450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible effect.\nIrbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10-600 mg. A less than proportional increase in oral absorption at doses beyond 600 mg (twice the maximal recommended dose) was observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. Peak plasma concentrations are attained at 1.5-2 hrs after oral administration. The total body and renal clearance are 157-176 and 3-3.5 mL/min, respectively. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan is 11-15 hrs. Steady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 3 days after initiation of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited accumulation of irbesartan (<20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. However, there was no difference in the half-life and accumulation of irbesartan. No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients.\nIrbesartan AUC and Cmax values were also somewhat greater in elderly subjects (=65 years) than those of young subjects (18-40 years). However, the terminal half-life was not significantly altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients.\nIrbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated by both biliary and renal pathways. After either oral or IV administration of 14C-irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity is recovered in the urine, and the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan.\nRenal Impairment: In patients with renal impairment or those undergoing haemodialysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis.\nHepatic Impairment: In patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis, the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not significantly altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: There was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity at clinically relevant doses. In preclinical safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (=250 mg/kg/day in rats and =100 mg/kg/day in macaques) caused a reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit). At very high doses (=500 mg/kg/day) degenerative changes in the kidney (eg, interstitial nephritis, tubular distension, basophilic tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the hypotensive effects of the drug which led to decreased renal perfusion.\nFurthermore, irbesartan-induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular cells (in rats at =90 mg/kg/day, in macaques at =10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the pharmacological action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not appear to have any relevance.\nThere was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity.\nFertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at oral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day), including mortality at the highest dose. No significant effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants, or live fetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival, development, or reproduction of offspring. Studies in animals indicate that the radiolabeled irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit fetuses. Irbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats.\nAnimal studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, hydroureter or SC oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, abortion or early resorption were noted at doses causing significant maternal toxicity, including mortality. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit.",

All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.\nThere is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious Gastrointestinal events.\nTwo large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of MI and stroke (see Contraindications).\nHypertension: NSAIDs, including Arcoxia, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including Arcoxia, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (Blood Pressure) should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.\nCongestive Heart Failure and Edema: Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients taking NSAIDs. Arcoxia should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure.\nGastrointestinal Effects: Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding and Perforation: NSAIDs, including Arcoxia, can cause serious Gastrointestinal adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only 1 in 5 patients, who develop a serious upper Gastrointestinal adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper Gastrointestinal ulcers, gross bleeding or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months and in about 2-4% of patients treated for 1 year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious Gastrointestinal event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.\nNSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a >10-fold increased risk for developing a Gastrointestinal bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for Gastrointestinal bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal Gastrointestinal events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.\nTo reduce the risk of gastrointestinal effect on NSAID therapy, the lowest effective dose must be given in short term therapy. Doctor and patients must be cautioned on signs and symptoms of ulceration and Gastrointestinal bleeding during NSAID therapy. If there is serious Gastrointestinal effects suspected, evaluate immediately and give additional treatment. For high-risk patients, alternative therapy that does not include NSAID can be considered.",
      "special-precautions": "Clinical trial suggests that the selective COX-2 inhibitor class of drugs may be associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events (especially MI and stroke), relative to placebo and some NSAIDs (naproxen). As the cardiovascular risks of selective COX-2 inhibitors may increase with dose and duration of exposure, the shortest duration possible and the lowest effective daily dose should be used. The patients need symptomatic relief and response to therapy should be re-evaluated periodically.\nPatients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events (eg, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking) or peripheral arterial disease should only be treated with etoricoxib after careful consideration.\nSelective COX-2 inhibitors are not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis because of their lack of effect on platelets. Because etoricoxib does not inhibit platelet aggregation, antiplatelet therapies should not be discontinued.\nThere is a further increase in the risk of Gastrointestinal adverse effects ( Gastrointestinal ulceration or other Gastrointestinal complications) for etoricoxib, other selective COX-2 inhibitors and NSAIDs, when taken concomitantly with acetylsalicylic acid (even at low doses). The relative differences in gastrointestinal safety between selective COX-2 inhibitors + acetylsalicylic acid vs NSAIDs + acetylsalicylic acid has not been adequately evaluated in long term clinical trials.\nIn patients with advanced renal disease, treatment with Arcoxia is not recommended. Clinical experience in patients with estimated CrCl of <30 mL/min is very limited. If therapy with Arcoxia must be initiated in such patients, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.\nRenal prostaglandins may play a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. Therefore, under conditions of compromised renal perfusion, administration of Arcoxia may cause a reduction in prostaglandin formation and secondarily, in renal blood flow and thereby impair renal function. Patients at greatest risk of this response are those with preexisting significantly impaired renal function, uncompensated heart failure or cirrhosis. Monitoring of renal function in such patients should be considered. As with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, discontinuation of therapy with Arcoxia would be expected to be followed by recovery to the pre-treatment state.\nCaution should be used when initiating treatment with Arcoxia in patients with considerable dehydration. It is advisable to rehydrate patients prior to starting therapy with Arcoxia.\nAs with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, fluid retention, edema and hypertension have been observed in some patients taking Arcoxia. The possibility of fluid retention, edema or hypertension should be taken into consideration when Arcoxia is used in patients with preexisting edema, hypertension or heart failure.\nEtoricoxib may be associated with more frequent and severe hypertension than some other NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors, particularly at high doses. Therefore, special attention should be paid to blood pressure monitoring during treatment with etoricoxib. If blood pressure rises significantly, alternative treatment should be considered.\nCaution should be exercised in patients with a medical history of ischemic heart disease because of the pharmacodynamic profile of COX-2 selective inhibitors noted previously.\nPhysicians should be aware that individual patients may develop upper Gastrointestinal ulcer complications irrespective of treatment. In clinical studies, the risk of endoscopically detected upper Gastrointestinal ulcers was lower in patients treated with Arcoxia 120 mg once daily than in patients treated with nonselective NSAIDs. While the risk of endoscopically detected ulcers was lower in patients treated with Arcoxia 120 mg than in patients treated with placebo. Upper Gastrointestinal ulcer complications have occurred in patients treated with Arcoxia. Independent of treatment, patients with a prior history of Gastrointestinal perforation, ulcers and bleeding (PUB) and patients >65 years are known to be at a higher risk for a PUB.\nElevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (approximately =3 times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials treated for up to 1 year with Arcoxia 60 mg and 90 mg daily. In active comparator portions of clinical trials, the incidence of elevated AST and/or ALT in patients treated with Arcoxia 60 mg and 90 mg daily was similar to that of patients treated with naproxen, but notably less than the incidence in the diclofenac group. These elevations resolved in patients treated with Arcoxia, with approximately half resolving while patients remained on therapy.\nA patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction or in whom an abnormal liver function test has occurred, should be evaluated for persistently abnormal liver function tests. If persistently abnormal liver function tests (3 times the upper limit of normal) are detected, Arcoxia should be discontinued.\nArcoxia should be used with caution in patients who have previously experienced acute asthmatic attacks, urticaria or rhinitis, which were precipitated by salicylates or nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Since the pathophysiology of these reactions is unknown, physicians should weigh the potential benefits of prescribing Arcoxia versus the potential risks.\nArcoxia may mask fever, which is a sign of infection. The physician should be aware of this when using Arcoxia in patients being treated for infection.\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: There is no information to suggest that Arcoxia affects a patient's ability to drive or operate machinery.\nCarcinogenicity: Etoricoxib was not carcinogenic in mice. Rats developed hepatocellular and thyroid follicular cell adenomas at >6 times the daily human dose (90 mg) based on systemic exposure when dosed daily for approximately 2 years. Tumors of these types are a species-specific consequence of hepatic CYP enzyme induction in the rat. These findings are consistent with other compounds associated with this induction. Etoricoxib has not been shown to cause hepatic CYP enzyme induction in humans.\nMutagenicity: Etoricoxib was found to be neither genotoxic nor mutagenic as described as follows. Etoricoxib was negative in the in vitro microbial and the TK6 human cell mutagenesis assays, with and without metabolic activation. There was no evidence of genotoxicity in the in vitro alkaline elution assay in rat hepatocytes and the in vitro chromosomal aberration assays in Chinese hamster ovary cells, with or without metabolic activation. In the in vivo alkaline elution/rat liver damage assays, etoricoxib did not induce DNA strand breaks in rat liver cells after oral administration of doses up to 300 mg/kg (1770 mg/m2; >20 times the daily adult dose [90 mg] based on systemic exposure). Similarly, there was no induction of chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow cells of male or female mice after the administration of oral doses of up to 1000 mg/kg (3000 mg/m2; approximately 10 times the daily adult dose [90 mg] based on systemic exposure).\nImpairment of Fertility: In female rats administered etoricoxib, there were no adverse effects for maternotoxicity, fertility and embryonic/fetal survival at dosages of 10 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to the daily adult human dose [90 mg] based on systemic exposure). At dosages of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the daily adult human dose [90 mg] based on systemic exposure), there were treatment-related decreases in the number of implants.\nHigh placental transfer of etoricoxib occurred in rabbits treated with 45 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the daily adult human dose [90 mg] based on systemic exposure), as evidenced by rabbit fetal plasma levels of approximately 60-70% of the mean maternal plasma drug levels. In pregnant rats treated with 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.5 times the daily adult human dose [90 mg] based on systemic exposure), there was approximately 70-80% placental transfer of etoricoxib.\nSignificant concentrations of etoricoxib were observed in the milk of lactating rats. The mean milk drug concentrations were approximately 2-fold the mean maternal plasma concentrations in rats administered doses up to 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.5 times the daily adult human dose [90 mg] based on systemic exposure).\nThere were no treatment-related effects on mating performance, fertility indices, embryonic/fetal survival, sperm count, motility, testicular/epididymal organ weights or histology in male rats administered dosages of etoricoxib up to 100 mg/kg/day (>6 times the daily adult human dose [90 mg] based on systemic exposure).\nUse in pregnancy: As with other drugs known to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, use of Arcoxia should be avoided in late pregnancy because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.\nReproductive studies conducted in rats and rabbits have demonstrated no evidence of developmental abnormalities at doses up to 15 mg/kg/day and 45 mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately 1.5 times [rat] and approximately 3 times [rabbit] the human dose [90 mg] based on systemic exposure). However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Arcoxia should be used during the first 2 trimesters of pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\nUse in lactation: Etoricoxib is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether Arcoxia is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the possible adverse effects of drugs that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis on nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\nUse in children: Safety and effectiveness of etoricoxib in pediatric patients have not been established.\nUse in the elderly: Pharmacokinetics in the elderly (=65 years) are similar to those in the young. In clinical studies, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients.",
      "adverse-reactions": "In clinical trials, Arcoxia was evaluated for safety in approximately 4800 individuals, including approximately 3400 patients with OA, RA or chronic low back pain (approximately 600 patients with OA or RA were treated for 1 year or longer).\nThe following drug-related adverse experiences were reported in clinical studies in patients with OA, RA or chronic low back pain treated for up to 12 weeks. These occurred in =1% of patients treated with Arcoxia and at an incidence greater than placebo: Asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, lower extremity edema, hypertension, dyspepsia, heartburn, nausea, headache, increased ALT and AST.\nThe adverse experience profile was similar in patients with OA or RA treated with Arcoxia for 1 year or longer.\nSeven thousand one hundred eleven (7111) patients were enrolled in an additional study in OA that compared the Gastrointestinal tolerability of etoricoxib 90 mg once daily (1.5 times above the dose recommended for OA) and diclofenac sodium 50 mg 3 times daily over a mean period of 9 months. The adverse experience profile on Arcoxia was generally similar to that reported in the Phase IIb/III placebo-controlled clinical studies; however, hypertension adverse experiences occurred at a higher rate on Arcoxia than on diclofenac.\nIn the initial clinical development program, approximately 3100 patients were treated with etoricoxib 60 mg daily for 12 weeks or longer. There was no discernible difference in the rate of serious thrombotic cardiovascular events between patients receiving etoricoxib 60 mg or non-naproxen NSAIDs. However, the rate of these events was higher in patients receiving etoricoxib compared with those receiving naproxen 500 mg twice daily.\nIn a clinical study for ankylosing spondylitis, patients were treated with Arcoxia 90 mg once daily for up to 1 year (n=126). The adverse experience profile in this study was generally similar to that reported in chronic studies in OA, RA and chronic low back pain.\nIn a clinical study for acute gouty arthritis, patients were treated with Arcoxia 120 mg once daily for 8 days.\nIn clinical studies for acute analgesia, patients were treated with Arcoxia 120 mg once daily for 1-7 days. The adverse experience profile in these studies was generally similar to that reported in the combined OA, RA and chronic low back pain studies.\nPost-Marketing Experience: The following adverse reactions have been reported in post-marketing experience: Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions.\nPsychiatric Disorders: Anxiety, insomnia, confusion, hallucinations.\nNervous System Disorders: Dysgeusia, somnolence.\nCardiac Disorders: Congestive heart failure.\nVascular Disorders: Hypertensive crisis.\nRespiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Bronchospasm.\nGastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain, oral and peptic ulcers including perforation and bleeding (mainly in elderly patients), vomiting, diarrhea.\nHepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatitis.\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioedema, pruritus, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, urticaria.\nRenal and Urinary Disorders: Renal insufficiency, including renal failure, usually reversible upon discontinuation of therapy (see Precautions).\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "Warfarin: In subjects stabilized on chronic warfarin therapy, the administration of Arcoxia 120 mg daily was associated with an approximate 13% increase in International Normalized Ratio (INR) prothrombin time. Standard monitoring of INR values should be conducted when therapy with Arcoxia is initiated or changed, particularly in the first few days, in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents.\nRifampin: Co-administration of Arcoxia with rifampin, a potent inducer of hepatic metabolism, produced a 65% decrease in etoricoxib plasma area under the curve (AUC). This interaction should be considered when Arcoxia is co-administered with rifampin.\nMethotrexate: Two studies investigated the effects of Arcoxia 60, 90 or 120 mg administered once daily for 7 days in patients receiving once-weekly methotrexate doses of 7.5-20 mg for rheumatoid arthritis. Arcoxia at 60 mg and 90 mg had no effect on methotrexate plasma concentrations (as measured by AUC) or renal clearance. In one study, Arcoxia 120 mg had no effect on methotrexate plasma concentrations (as measured by AUC) or renal clearance. In the other study, Arcoxia 120 mg increased methotrexate plasma concentrations by 28% (as measured by AUC) and reduced renal clearance of methotrexate by 13%. Monitoring for methotrexate-related toxicity should be considered when Arcoxia at doses >90 mg daily and methotrexate are administered concomitantly.\nDiuretics, Angiotension Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Antagonists (AIIAs): Reports suggest that NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors may diminish the antihypertensive effect of diuretics, ACE inhibitors and AIIAs. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking Arcoxia concomitantly with these products.\nLithium: Reports suggest that nonselective NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors may increase plasma lithium levels. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking Arcoxia concomitantly with lithium.\nAspirin: Arcoxia can be used concomitantly with low-dose aspirin at doses for cardiovascular prophylaxis. However, concomitant administration of low-dose aspirin with Arcoxia results in an increased rate of Gastrointestinal ulceration or other complications compared to use of Arcoxia alone. At steady-state, etoricoxib 120 mg once daily had no effect on the antiplatelet activity of low-dose aspirin (81 mg once daily). (See Precautions).\nOral Contraceptives: Arcoxia 60 mg given concomitantly with an oral contraceptive containing 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE) and 0.5-1 mg norethindrone for 21 days increased the steady state AUC0-24hr of EE by 37%. Arcoxia 120 mg given with the same oral contraceptive concomitantly or separated by 12 hrs, increased the steady-state AUC0-24hr of EE by 50-60%. This increase in EE concentration should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for use with etoricoxib. An increase in EE exposure can increase the incidence of adverse events associated with oral contraceptives (eg, venous thromboembolic events in women at risk).\nHormone Replacement Therapy: Administration of Arcoxia 120 mg with hormone replacement therapy consisting of conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg Premarin) for 28 days, increased the mean steady state AUC0-24hr of unconjugated estrone (41%), equilin (76%) and 17-ß-estradiol (22%). The effect of the recommended chronic doses of Arcoxia (60 mg and 90 mg) has not been studied. The effects of Arcoxia 120 mg on the exposure (AUC0-24hr) to these estrogenic components of Premarin were less than half of those observed when Premarin was administered alone and the dose was increased from 0.625-1.25 mg. The clinical significance of these increases is unknown and higher doses of Premarin were not studied in combination with Arcoxia. These increases in estrogenic concentration should be taken into consideration when selecting postmenopausal hormone therapy for use with Arcoxia.\nOthers: In drug interaction studies, Arcoxia did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of prednisone/prednisolone or digoxin.\nAntacids and ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4) did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of Arcoxia.",
      "storage": "Store below 30°C.",
      "mechanism": "Arcoxia (etoricoxib) is a member of a class of arthritis/analgesia medications called coxibs. It is a highly selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).\nPharmacology: Mechanism of Action: Arcoxia is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activities in animal models. Arcoxia is a potent, orally active, highly selective COX-2 inhibitor within and above the clinical dose range. Two isoforms of cyclooxygenase have been identified: Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 is responsible for prostaglandin-mediated normal physiologic functions eg, gastric cytoprotection and platelet aggregation. Inhibition of COX-1 by nonselective NSAIDs has been associated with gastric damage and platelet inhibition. COX-2 has been shown to be primarily responsible for the synthesis of prostanoid mediators of pain, inflammation and fever. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by etoricoxib decreases these clinical signs and symptoms with decreased Gastrointestinal toxicity and without effects on platelet function.\nAcross clinical pharmacology studies, Arcoxia produced dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 without inhibition of COX-1 at doses up to 150 mg daily.\nThe influence on gastroprotective COX-1 activity was also assessed in a clinical study where prostaglandin synthesis was measured in gastric biopsy samples from subjects administered either Arcoxia 120 mg daily, naproxen 500 mg twice daily or placebo. Arcoxia did not inhibit gastric prostaglandin synthesis as compared to placebo. In contrast, naproxen inhibited gastric prostaglandin synthesis by approximately 80% compared with placebo. These data further support the COX-2 selectivity of Arcoxia.\nPlatelet Function: Multiple doses of Arcoxia up to 150 mg administered daily up to 9 days had no effect on bleeding time relative to placebo. Similarly, bleeding time was not altered in a single-dose study with Arcoxia 250 or 500 mg. There was no inhibition of ex vivo arachidonic acid- or collagen-induced platelet aggregation at steady-state with doses of Arcoxia up to 150 mg. These findings are consistent with the COX-2 selectivity of etoricoxib.\nPharmacokinetics: Absorption: Orally administered etoricoxib is well absorbed. The mean oral bioavailability is approximately 100%. Following 120-mg once-daily dosing to steady-state, the peak plasma concentration (geometric mean Cmax = 3.6 mcg/mL) was observed at approximately 1 hr (Tmax) after administration to fasted adults. The geometric mean AUC0-24hr was 37.8 mcg·hr/mL. The pharmacokinetics of etoricoxib are linear across the clinical dose range.\nIn studies specifically designed to measure the onset of action of etoricoxib, the onset of action occurred as early as 29 min after dosing.\nA standard meal had no clinically meaningful effect on the extent or rate of absorption of a dose of etoricoxib 120 mg. In clinical trials, etoricoxib was administered without regards to food.\nThe pharmacokinetics of etoricoxib in 12 healthy subjects were similar (comparable AUC, Cmax within approximately 20%) when administered alone, with a magnesium/aluminum hydroxide antacid or a calcium carbonate antacid (approximately 50 mEq acid-neutralizing capacity).\nDistribution: Etoricoxib is approximately 92% bound to human plasma protein over the range of concentrations of 0.05-5 mcg/mL. The volume of distribution at steady-state (Vdss) is approximately 120 L in humans.\nEtoricoxib crosses the placenta in rats and rabbits and the blood-brain barrier in rats.\nMetabolism: Etoricoxib is extensively metabolized with <1% of a dose recovered in urine as the parent drug. The major route of metabolism to form the 6'-hydroxymethyl derivative is catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes.\nFive metabolites have been identified in man. The principal metabolite is the 6'-carboxylic acid derivative of etoricoxib formed by further oxidation of the 6'-hydroxymethyl derivative. These principal metabolites either demonstrate no measurable activity or are only weakly active as COX-2 inhibitors. None of these metabolites inhibit COX-1.\nElimination: Following administration of a single 25-mg radiolabeled IV dose of etoricoxib to healthy subjects, 70% of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 20% in feces, mostly as metabolites. Less than 2% was recovered as unchanged drug.\nElimination of etoricoxib occurs almost exclusively through metabolism followed by renal excretion. Steady-state concentrations of etoricoxib are reached within 7 days of once-daily administration of 120 mg, with an accumulation ratio of approximately 2, corresponding to an accumulation t½ of approximately 22 hrs. The plasma clearance is estimated to be approximately 50 mL/min.\nCharacteristics in Patients (Special Populations): Gender: The pharmacokinetics of etoricoxib are similar between men and women (see Dosage and Administration).\nElderly: Pharmacokinetics in the elderly (=65 years) are similar to those in the young. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see Dosage and Administration).\nRace: There is no clinically important effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of etoricoxib (see Dosage and Administration).\nHepatic Insufficiency: Patients with mild hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh score 5-6) administered etoricoxib 60 mg once daily had an approximately 16% higher mean AUC as compared to healthy subjects given the same regimen. Patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh score 7-9) administered etoricoxib 60 mg every other day had similar mean AUC to the healthy subjects given etoricoxib 60 mg once daily. There are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh score >9). (See Dosage and Administration.)\nRenal Insufficiency: The pharmacokinetics of a single dose of etoricoxib 120 mg in patients with moderate-to-severe renal insufficiency and patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis were not significantly different from those in healthy subjects. Hemodialysis contributed negligibly to elimination (dialysis clearance approximately 50 mL/min).\nPediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of etoricoxib in pediatric patients (<12 years) have not been studied.\nIn a pharmacokinetic study (N=16) conducted in adolescents (12-17 years) the pharmacokinetics in adolescents weighing 40-60 kg given etoricoxib 60 mg once daily and in adolescents >60 kg given etoricoxib 90 mg once daily were similar to the pharmacokinetics in adults given etoricoxib 90 mg once daily. Safety and effectiveness of etoricoxib in pediatric patients have not been established.\nToxicology: Acute Toxicity: The approximate oral LD50 was 1499 mg/kg in both female mice and rats, while the intraperitoneal approximate oral LD50 was 599 mg/kg in female mice and 238 mg/kg in female rats. The approximate oral LD50 in rats and mice are >12 times the acute daily adult human dose (120 mg) based on systemic exposure.\nChronic Toxicity: The toxicity potential of etoricoxib was evaluated in a series of repeated-dose oral toxicity studies up to 53 weeks in dogs and rats. In each species, the principal treatment-related changes were associated with renal and gastrointestinal toxicity. Both the renal and gastrointestinal lesions were shown to occur at dosages above the intended chronic clinical dose of 90 mg daily.\nIn dogs, etoricoxib administered orally at dosages of 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 20 times the daily adult human dose [90 mg] based on systemic exposure) for 14 weeks, toxicity was characterized by gastritis, gastrointestinal ulceration and renal papillary necrosis. No toxicity was seen in dogs administered 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the daily adult human dose based on systemic exposure) for 53 weeks.\nIn rats, etoricoxib administered orally at dosages of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the daily adult human dose [90 mg] based on systemic exposure) following 27 weeks of administration produced gastrointestinal ulceration, as well as increased hepatic weights in female rats. At 53 weeks, the increased hepatic weights observed correlated with centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy due to hepatic CYP enzyme induction. No renal or gastrointestinal changes were noted in rats administered 10 mg/kg/day for 53 weeks (approximately equivalent to the daily adult human dose based on systemic exposure).\nTeratogenicity: No teratogenic effects were observed in rabbits and rats administered etoricoxib at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately equal to and approximately 1.5 times, respectively, the daily adult human dose [90 mg] based on systemic exposure).",

This combination should not be used outside clinical trials.\nThere are no data to support the safe use of Arimidex in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, or patients with severe impairment of renal function (CrCl <20 mL/min).\nAs Arimidex lowers circulating estrogen levels, it may cause a reduction in bone mineral density with a possible consequent increase risk of fractures. This possible increased risk should be managed according to treatment guidelines for managing bone health in postmenopausal women.\nWomen with osteoporosis or at risk of osteoporosis should have their bone mineral density formally assessed by bone densitometry at the commencement of treatment and at regular intervals thereafter.

If bleeding persists, further evaluation should be considered.\nAs Arimidex lowers circulating estrogen levels, it may cause a reduction in bone mineral density placing some patients at a higher risk of fracture (see Precautions).\nIn a large phase III study conducted in 9366 postmenopausal women with operable breast cancer treated for 5 years, ischaemic cardiovascular events were reported more frequently in patients treated with Arimidex compared to those treated with tamoxifen, although the difference was not statistically significant. The observed difference was mainly due to more reports of angina pectoris and was associated with a sub-group of patients with preexisting ischaemic heart disease.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",

      "mechanism": "Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Enzyme inhibitors. ATC Code: L02BG03.\nPharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: Arimidex is a potent and highly selective nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor. In postmenopausal women, estradiol is produced primarily from the conversion of androstenedione to estrone through the aromatase enzyme complex in peripheral tissues. Estrone is subsequently converted to estradiol. Reducing circulating estradiol levels have been shown to produce a beneficial effect in women with breast cancer.\nIn postmenopausal women, Arimidex at a daily dose of 1 mg produced estradiol suppression of >80% using a highly sensitive assay.\nArimidex does not possess any progestogenic, androgenic or estrogenic activity.\nDaily doses of Arimidex up to 10 mg do not have any effect on cortisol or aldosterone secretion, measured before or after standard adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge testing. Corticoid supplements are therefore, not needed.\nPrimary Adjuvant Treatment of Early Breast Cancer: In a large phase III study conducted in 9366 postmenopausal women with operable breast cancer treated for 5 years, Arimidex was shown to be statistically superior to tamoxifen in disease-free survival. A greater magnitude of benefit was observed for disease-free survival in favor of Arimidex versus tamoxifen for the prospectively defined hormone-receptor positive population.\nArimidex was statistically superior to tamoxifen in time to recurrence. The difference was of greater magnitude than in disease-free survival for both the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and hormone-receptor positive population.\nArimidex was statistically superior to tamoxifen in terms of time to distant recurrence. There was also a numerical trend in favor of Arimidex for distant disease-free survival.\nThe incidence of contralateral breast cancer was statistically reduced for Arimidex compared to tamoxifen.\nThe overall survival benefit of tamoxifen was maintained with Arimidex. The additional analysis of time to death following recurrence showed a numerical trend in favour of Arimidex compared to tamoxifen.\nOverall, Arimidex was well tolerated. The following adverse events were reported regardless of causality. Patients receiving Arimidex had a decrease in hot flushes, vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, endometrial cancer, venous thromboembolic events and ischemic cerebrovascular events compared with patients receiving tamoxifen. Patients receiving Arimidex had an increase in joint disorders (including arthritis, arthrosis and arthralgia) and fractures compared with patients receiving tamoxifen. A fracture rate of 22 per 1000 patient-years was observed on Arimidex and 15 per 1000 patient-years with the tamoxifen group with a median follow-up of 68 months. The fracture rate for Arimidex falls within the broad range of the fracture rates reported in an age-matched postmenopausal population.\nThe combination of Arimidex and tamoxifen did not demonstrate any efficacy benefits in comparison with tamoxifen in all patients as well as in the hormone-receptor positive population. This treatment arm was discontinued from the study.\nAdjuvant Treatment of Early Breast Cancer for Patients Being Treated with Adjuvant Tamoxifen: In a phase III trial (ABCSG 8) conducted in 2579 postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive early breast cancer being treated with adjuvant tamoxifen, patients had a superior disease-free survival when switched to Arimidex compared with those continuing on tamoxifen.\nTime to any recurrence, time to local or distant recurrence and time to distant recurrence confirmed a statistical advantage for Arimidex, consistent with the results of disease-free survival. The incidence of contralateral breast cancer was very low in the 2 treatment arms, with a numerical advantage for Arimidex. Overall survival was similar for the 2 treatment groups.\nTwo further similar trials (GABG/ARNO 95 and ITA) with Arimidex, as well as a combined analysis of ABCSG 8 and GABG/ARNO 95, supported those results.\nThe Arimidex safety profile in these 3 studies was consistent with the known safety profile established in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive early breast cancer.\nPharmacokinetics: Absorption of anastrozole is rapid and maximum plasma concentrations typically occur within 2 hrs of dosing (under fasted conditions). Anastrozole is eliminated slowly with a plasma elimination half-life (t½) of 40-50 hrs. Food slightly decreases the rate but not the extent of absorption. The small change in the rate of absorption is not expected to result in a clinically significant effect on steady-state plasma concentrations during once-daily dosing of Arimidex tablets. Approximately 90-95% of plasma anastrozole steady-state concentrations are attained after 7 daily doses. There is no evidence of time or dose-dependency of anastrozole pharmacokinetic parameters. Anastrozole pharmacokinetics are independent of age in postmenopausal women. It is only 40% bound to plasma proteins.\nAnastrozole is extensively metabolized by postmenopausal women with <10% of the dose excreted in the urine unchanged within 72 hrs of dosing and the remainder (about 60% of the dose) is excreted in the urine as metabolites. Metabolism of anastrozole occurs by N-dealkylation, hydroxylation and glucuronidation. The metabolites are excreted primarily via the urine. Triazole, the major metabolite in plasma, does not inhibit aromatase.\nThe apparent oral clearance of anastrozole in volunteers with stable hepatic cirrhosis or renal impairment was in the range observed in healthy volunteers.\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: Acute Toxicity: In acute toxicity studies in rodents, the median lethal dose of anastrozole was >100 mg/kg/day by the oral route and >50 mg/kg/day by the intraperitoneal route. In an oral acute toxicity study in the dog, the median lethal dose was >45 mg/kg/day.\nChronic Toxicity: Multiple-dose toxicity studies utilized rats and dogs. No no-effect levels were established for anastrozole in the toxicity studies, but those effects that were observed at the low dose (1 mg/kg/day) and mid-doses (dog, 3 mg/kg/day; rat, 5 mg/kg/day) were related to either the pharmacological or enzyme-inducing properties of anastrozole and were unaccompanied by significant toxic or degenerative changes.\nMutagenicity: Genetic toxicology studies with anastrozole show that it is not a mutagen or a clastogen.\nReproductive Toxicology: Oral administration of anastrozole to pregnant rats and rabbits caused no teratogenic effects at doses up to 1 and 0.2 mg/kg/day, respectively. Those effects that were seen (placental enlargement in rats and pregnancy failure in rabbits) were related to the pharmacology of the compound.\nOral administration of anastrozole to female rats produced a high incidence of infertility at 1 mg/kg/day and increased pre-implantation loss at 0.02 mg/kg/day. These effects were related to the pharmacology of the compound and were completely reversed after 5-week compound withdrawal period.\nThe survival of liters born to rats given anastrozole at =0.02 mg/kg/day (from day 17 of pregnancy to day 22 postpartum) was compromised. These effects were related to the pharmacological effects of the compound on parturition. There were no adverse effects on behavior or reproductive performance of the 1st generation offspring attributable to maternal treatment with anastrozole.\nCarcinogenicity: A 2-year rat oncogenicity study resulted in an increase in incidence of hepatic neoplasms and uterine stromal polyps in females and thyroid adenomas in males at the high dose (25 mg/kg/day) only. These changes occurred at a dose which represents 100-fold greater exposure than occurs at human therapeutic doses, and are considered not to be clinically relevant to the treatment of patients with anastrozole.\nA 2-year mouse oncogenicity study resulted in the induction of benign ovarian tumors and a disturbance in the incidence of lymphoreticular neoplasms (fewer histiocytic sarcomas in females and more deaths as a result of lymphomas). These changes are considered to be mouse-specific effects of aromatase inhibition and not clinically relevant to the treatment of patients with anastrozole.",

Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible following diagnosis and continued for up to 8 days or until hospital discharge.\nIf a patient is to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), while on Arixtra, unfractionated heparin (UFH) as per standard practice should be administered during PCI, taking into account the patient's potential risk of bleeding, including the time since the last dose of Arixtra (see Precautions).\nThe timing of restarting Arixtra SC after sheath removal should be based on clinical judgment. In the UA/NSTEMI clinical trial, treatment with Arixtra was restarted no earlier than 2 hrs after sheath removal.\nIn patients who are to undergo coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, Arixtra, where possible, should not be given during the 24 hrs before surgery and may be restarted 48 hrs postoperatively.\nTreatment of ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI): Recommended Dose: 2.5 mg once daily. The1st dose of Arixtra is administered IV and subsequent doses are administered by SC injection. Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible following diagnosis and continued for up to 8 days or until hospital discharge if that occurs earlier.\nIf a patient is to undergo non-primary PCI while on Arixtra, UFH as per local practice should be administered during PCI, taking into account the patient's potential risk of bleeding, including the time since the last dose of Arixtra (see Precautions).\nThe timing of restarting Arixtra SC after sheath removal should be based on clinical judgment. In the pivotal STEMI clinical trial, treatment with Arixtra was restarted no earlier than 3 hrs after sheath removal.\nIn patients who are to undergo CABG surgery, Arixtra where possible, should not be given during the 24 hrs before surgery and may be restarted 48 hrs postoperatively.\nSpecial Populations: Children: The safety and efficacy of Arixtra in patients <17 years has not been established.\nElderly =75 years: Arixtra should be used with caution in elderly patients as renal function decreases with age (see Renal Impairment as follows and Precautions). In patients undergoing surgery, the timing of the 1st dose of Arixtra requires strict adherence (see Precautions).\nPatients with Body Weight <50 kg: Patients with body weight <50 kg are at increased risk of bleeding (see Precautions). In patients undergoing surgery, the timing of the 1st dose of Arixtra requires strict adherence (see Precautions).\nRenal Impairment: Prevention of VTE: Arixtra should not be used in patients with a CrCl <30 mL/min (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions and Precautions). No dosage reduction is required for patients with a CrCl =30 mL/min. In patients undergoing surgery, the timing of the 1st dose of Arixtra requires strict adherence.\nTreatment of UA/NSTEMI and STEMI: Arixtra is not recommended for use in patients with a CrCl <20 mL/min (see Precautions). No dosage reduction is required for patients with a CrCl =20 mL/min.\nHepatic Impairment: No dosing adjustment of Arixtra is necessary (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions). In patients with severe hepatic impairment, Arixtra should be used with caution (see Precautions).\nAdministration: SC: The sites of SC injection should alternate between the left and the right anterolateral and left and right posterolateral abdominal wall. To avoid the loss of Arixtra when using the pre-filled syringe, do not expel the air bubble from the syringe before the injection. The whole length of the needle should be inserted perpendicularly into a skin fold held between the thumb and the forefinger. The skin fold should be held throughout the injection.\nArixtra is intended for use under a physician's guidance. Patients may self-inject only if their physician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow-up as necessary. Proper training in SC injection technique should be provided. Instructions for self-administration is included in the package leaflet (see Instructions for Use and Handling under Cautions for Usage).\nIV: First Dose in STEMI Patients Only: IV administration should be through an existing IV line either directly or using a small volume (25 or 50 mL) 0.9% saline minibag. To avoid the loss of Arixtra when using the pre-filled syringe, do not expel the air bubble from the syringe before the injection. The IV tubing should be well-flushed with saline after injection to ensure that all of Arixtra is administered. If administered via a minibag, the infusion should be given over 1-2 min.",
      "over-dosage": "Symptoms: Arixtra doses above the recommended regimen may lead to an increased risk of bleeding.\nTreatment: Overdose associated with bleeding complications should lead to treatment discontinuation and search for the primary cause. Initiation of appropriate therapy which may include surgical haemostasis, blood replacements, fresh plasma transfusion, plasmapheresis should be considered.",
      "contra-indications": "Known hypersensitivity to fondaparinux or to any of the excipients of Arixtra. Clinically active significant bleeding; acute bacterial endocarditis; severe renal impairment (CrCl <20 mL/min).",
      "special-precautions": "Route of Administration: Arixtra must not be administered IM (see Dosage and Administration).\nPercutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) and Risk of Guiding Catheter Thrombus: In STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI for reperfusion, the use of Arixtra prior to and during PCI is not recommended. Similarly, in UA/NSTEMI patients with life-threatening conditions that require urgent revascularization, the use of Arixtra prior to and during PCI is not recommended. These are patients with refractory or recurrent angina associated with dynamic ST deviation, heart failure, life-threatening arrhythmias or haemodynamic instability. In UA/NSTEMI and STEMI patients undergoing non-primary PCI, the use of Arixtra as the sole anticoagulant during PCI is not recommended, therefore UFH should be used according to local practice (see Dosage and Administration).\nThere are limited data on the use of UFH during non-primary PCI in patients treated with Arixtra (see Clinical Studies under Actions).\nIn those patients who underwent non-primary PCI 6-24 hrs after the last dose of Arixtra, the median dose of UFH was 8000 IU and the incidence of major bleeding was 2% (2/98). In those patients who underwent non-primary PCI <6 hrs after the last dose of Arixtra, the median dose of UFH was 5000 IU and the incidence of major bleeding was 4.1% (2/49).\nClinical trials have shown a low but increased risk of guiding catheter thrombus in patients treated with Arixtra for anticoagulation during PCI compared to control. Incidences in non-primary PCI in UA/NSTEMI were 1% versus 0.3% (Arixtra vs enoxaparin) and in primary PCI in STEMI were 1.2% versus 0% (Arixtra vs control).\nHaemorrhage: Arixtra, like other anticoagulants should be used with caution in conditions with an increased risk of hemorrhage (eg, congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative gastrointestinal disease, recent intracranial hemorrhage; shortly after brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery).\nAgents that may enhance the risk of hemorrhage should not be administered concomitantly with fondaparinux. These agents include desirudin, fibrinolytic agents, GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, heparin, heparinoids or Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH). Other antiplatelet medicinal products (acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole, sulfinpyrazone, ticlopidine or clopidogrel) and NSAIDs should be used with caution. If co-administration is essential, close monitoring is necessary.\nPrevention of VTE: Other medicinal products enhancing the risk of haemorrhage, with the exception of vitamin K antagonists used concomitantly for treatment of VTE, should not be administered with Arixtra. If co-administration is essential, close monitoring is recommended (see Interactions).\nPrevention of VTE Following Surgery (Timing of 1st Arixtra Injection): The timing of the 1st injection requires strict adherence. The 1st dose should be given no earlier than 6 hrs following surgical closure and only after haemostasis has been established. Administration before 6 hrs has been associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. Patient groups at particular risk are those =75 years, body weight of <50 kg or renal impairment with CrCl <50 mL/min.\nTreatment of UA/NSTEMI and STEMI: Arixtra should be used with caution in patients who are being treated concomitantly with other medicinal products that increase the risk of haemorrhage (eg, GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors or thrombolytics).\nSpinal/Epidural Anaesthesia/Spinal Puncture: Epidural or spinal haematomas that may result in long-term or permanent paralysis can occur with the use of anticoagulants and spinal/epidural anaesthesia or spinal puncture. The risk of these rare events may be higher with postoperative use of indwelling epidural catheters or the concomitant use of other medicinal products affecting haemostasis.\nLow Body Weight: Patients with body weight <50 kg are at increased risk of bleeding. Elimination of Arixtra decreases with weight decrease. Arixtra should be used with caution in these patients (see Dosage and Administration).\nRenal Impairment: The plasma clearance of fondaparinux decreases with the severity of renal impairment and is associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions). Due to the limited clinical data available for the prevention and treatment of VTE, Arixtra should not be used in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min.\nFor the treatment of UA/NSTEMI and STEMI, there are limited clinical data available on the use of Arixtra 2.5 mg once daily in patients with CrCl between 20-30 mL/min. Therefore the physician should determine if the benefit of treatment outweighs the risk (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions and Dosage and Administration). Arixtra is not recommended in patients with CrCl <20 mL/min.\nSevere Hepatic Impairment: In patients with an elevation in prothrombin time, the use of Arixtra should be considered with caution, because of an increased risk of bleeding due to a possible deficiency of coagulation factors in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see Dosage and Administration).\nHeparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT): Arixtra does not bind to platelet factor 4 and does not cross-react with sera from patients with HIT-type II. No clinical experience exists from the use of Arixtra in patients with HIT-type II and Arixtra should not be used in such patients.\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and to use machines have been performed.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: There are limited clinical data available on exposed pregnancies. Arixtra should not be prescribed to pregnant women unless the benefit outweighs the risk.\nFondaparinux is excreted in rat milk but it is not know whether fondaparinux is excreted in human milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Arixtra.\nUse in the elderly: The elderly population is at increased risk of bleeding. As renal function generally decreases with age, elderly patients may show reduced elimination and increased exposure of Arixtra. Arixtra should be used with caution in elderly patients (see Dosage and Administration).",

The incidence of adjudicated major bleeding was 2.1% (fondaparinux) versus 4.1% (enoxaparin) up to and including day 9 in the Phase III UA/NSTEMI study and the incidence of adjudicated severe haemorrhage by modified TIMI criteria was 1.1% (fondaparinux) versus 1.4% [control (UFH/placebo)] up to and including day 9 in the Phase III STEMI study.\nIn the Phase III UA/NSTEMI study, the most commonly reported non-bleeding adverse events (reported in at least 1% of subjects on fondaparinux) were headache, chest pain and atrial fibrillation.\nIn the Phase III study in STEMI patients, the most commonly reported non-bleeding adverse events (reported in at least 1% of subjects on fondaparinux) were atrial fibrillation, pyrexia, chest pain, headache, ventricular tachycardia, vomiting and hypotension.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "Fondaparinux does not markedly inhibit CYP-450s (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4) in vitro. Thus, Arixtra is not expected to interact with other medicinal products in vivo by inhibition of CYP-mediated metabolism.\nSince fondaparinux does not bind significantly to plasma proteins other than ATIII, no interaction with other medicinal products by protein-binding displacement is expected.\nBleeding risk is increased with concomitant administration of fondaparinux and agents that may enhance the risk of haemorrhage (see Precautions).\nIn clinical studies performed with fondaparinux, the concomitant use of warfarin (oral anticoagulant), acetylsalicylic acid (platelet inhibitor), piroxicam (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory) and digoxin (cardiac glycoside) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of fondaparinux. In addition, fondaparinux neither influenced the INR activity of warfarin, nor the bleeding time under acetylsalicylic acid or piroxicam treatment, nor the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin at steady-state.\nFollow-Up Therapy with Another Anticoagulant Medicinal Product: If follow-up treatment is to be initiated with heparin or LMWH, the 1st injection should, as a general rule, be given 1 day after the last fondaparinux injection.\nIf follow-up treatment with a vitamin K antagonist is required, treatment with fondaparinux should be continued until the target INR value has been reached.\nIncompatibilities: In the absence of compatibility studies, Arixtra must not be mixed with other medicinal products.",
      "pregnancy-safe": "Category B: Either animal-reproduction studies have not demonstrated a foetal risk but there are no controlled studies in pregnant women or animal-reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect (other than a decrease in fertility) that was not confirmed in controlled studies in women in the 1st trimester (and there is no evidence of a risk in later trimesters).\nCaution For Usage Instructions for Use and Handling: Parenteral solutions should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.\nArixtra is administered by SC or IV injection. It must not be administered by IM injection.\nThe SC injection is administered in the same way as with a standard syringe. IV administration should be through an existing IV line either directly or using a small volume (25 or 50 mL) 0.9% saline minibag.\nArixtra pre-filled syringe has been designed with an automatic needle protection system to prevent needle stick injuries following injection.\nInstruction for self-administration by SC injection is included in the package leaflet.\nAny unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.\nInstructions for Use: Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry them with a towel.\nRemove the syringe from the carton and check that the expiry date has not passed, the solution is clear, colourless and does not contain particles and the syringe has not been opened or damaged.\nSit or lie down in a comfortable position. Choose a place in the lower abdominal (tummy) area, at least 5 cm below the belly button. Alternate the left and right side of the lower abdominal area at each injection. This will help reduce injection site discomfort. If injecting in the lower abdominal area is not possible, ask the nurse or doctor for advice.\nClean the injection area with an alcohol wipe.\nGently pinch the skin that has been cleaned to make a fold. Hold the fold between the thumb and the forefinger during the entire injection.\nHold the syringe firmly by the finger grip. Insert the full length of the needle at right angles into the skin fold.\nInject all of the contents of the syringe by pressing down on the plunger as far as it goes.\nRelease the plunger and the needle will automatically withdraw from the skin and go back into the security sleeve where it will be locked permanently.",
      "storage": "Store below 25°C. Do not freeze.\nShelf-Life: If Arixtra is added to a 0.9% saline minibag, it should ideally be infused immediately, but can be stored at room temperature for up to 24 hrs.",

Each syringle contains fondaparinux 10 mg in 0.8 mL solution for injection.\nIt also contains sodium chloride, water for injection, hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment as necessary) as excipients.\nArixtra is a sterile, preservative-free, clear and colorless injectable solution for SC and IV use, with a pH between 5 and 8, in a single dose pre-filled syringe.",
      "mechanism": "Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Antithrombotic agents. ATC Code: B01AX05.\nPharmacology: Mechanism of Action: Fondaparinux is a synthetic and selective inhibitor of activated Factor X (Xa). The antithrombotic activity of fondaparinux is the result of antithrombin III (ATIII) mediated selective inhibition of Factor Xa. By binding selectively to ATIII, fondaparinux potentiates (about 300 times) the innate neutralization of Factor Xa by ATIII. Neutralization of Factor Xa interrupts the blood coagulation cascade and inhibits both thrombin formation and thrombus development. Fondaparinux does not inactivate thrombin (activated Factor II) and has no known effects on platelet function.\nPharmacodynamics: At the 2.5-mg dose, Arixtra does not have a clinically relevant effect on routine coagulation tests eg, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), activated clotting time (ACT) or prothrombin time (PT)/international normalised ratio (INR) tests in plasma, nor bleeding or fibrinolytic activity.\nFondaparinux does not cross-react with sera from patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II.\nAnti-Xa Activity: The pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux are derived from fondaparinux plasma concentrations quantified via anti-factor Xa activity. Only fondaparinux can be used to calibrate the anti-Xa assay. The international standards of heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are not appropriate for this use. As a result, the concentration of fondaparinux is expressed as milligrams (mg) of the fondaparinux calibrator/L.\nClinical Studies: Prevention of Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE) in Patients Undergoing Major Orthopaedic Surgery of the Lower Limbs and Treated up to 9 Days: The clinical program included patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery of the lower limbs eg, hip fracture, major knee surgery or hip replacement surgery. Arixtra 2.5 mg once daily started 6-8 hrs postoperatively was compared with enoxaparin 40 mg once daily started 12 hrs before surgery or 30 mg twice daily started 12-24 hrs after surgery. Both treatments were administered for 7±2 days.\nIn a pooled analysis of these studies, Arixtra was associated with a significant decrease in VTE compared to enoxaparin (6.8% vs 13.7%, respectively), irrespective of the type of surgery performed. The majority of endpoint events consisted mainly of distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but the incidence of proximal DVT was also significantly reduced. The incidence of symptomatic VTE, including pulmonary embolism (PE) was not significantly different between treatment groups.\nIn studies versus enoxaparin 40 mg once daily started 12 hrs before surgery, major bleeding was observed in 3.3% of Arixtra patients treated with the recommended dose, compared to 2.6% with enoxaparin. In patients treated with Arixtra according to the recommended regimen (6 hrs after surgery), the rate of major bleeding was 2.8%. In studies versus enoxaparin 30 mg twice daily started 12-24 hrs after surgery, major bleeding was observed in 1.9% of Arixtra patients treated with the recommended dose, compared to 1.1% with enoxaparin.\nExtended Prophylaxis: Prevention of VTE in Patients Undergoing Hip Fracture Surgery Treated for up to 24 Days Following an Initial Prophylaxis of 1 Week: Following treatment with Arixtra 2.5 mg for 7±1 day, hip fracture surgery patients were randomised to receive Arixtra 2.5 mg once daily or placebo for an additional 21±2 days.\nExtended prophylaxis with Arixtra provided a significant reduction in the overall rate of VTE compared with placebo (1.4% vs 35%, respectively). Arixtra also provided a significant reduction in the rate of symptomatic VTE (0.3% vs 2.7%, respectively). Major bleeding, all at surgical site and none fatal, was observed in 2.4% Arixtra patients compared to 0.6% with placebo.\nPrevention of VTE in Patients Undergoing Abdominal Surgery at Risk of Thromboembolic Events: Patients were randomised to receive either Arixtra 2.5 mg once daily or dalteparin 5000 IU once daily, with one 2500 IU preoperative injection and a first 2500 IU postoperative injection, for 7±2 days following abdominal surgery.\nArixtra was non-inferior to dalteparin (VTE rates 4.6% vs 6.1%, respectively). The incidence of symptomatic VTE was similar between treatment groups (0.4% on Arixtra vs 0.3% on dalteparin).\nIn patients undergoing cancer surgery, representing the major subgroup of the clinical study (69% of the population), the VTE rate was 4.7% in the Arixtra group versus 7.7% in the dalteparin group.\nMajor bleeding was observed in 3.4% of the patients in the Arixtra group and in 2.4% of the dalteparin group. In patients treated with Arixtra according to the recommended regimen (6 hrs after surgery), the rate of major bleeding was 2.8%.\nPrevention of VTE in Medical Patients: Acutely ill medical patients, aged =60 years and expected to require bed rest for at least 4 days, were randomised to receive either Arixtra 2.5 mg once daily or placebo for 6-14 days. Arixtra significantly reduced the overall rate of VTE compared to placebo (5.6% vs 10.5%, respectively). The majority of events were asymptomatic distal DVT. Arixtra also significantly reduced the rate of adjudicated fatal PE (0% vs 1.2%, respectively). Major bleeding was observed in 1 patient (0.2%) in each group.\nTreatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism: In patients with confirmed diagnosis of acute symptomatic DVT, Arixtra 5 mg (body weight less than 50 kg), 7.5 mg (body weight 50-100 kg) once daily, was compared to enoxaparine 1 mg/kg SC twice daily. Patients were treated for at least 5 days in conjunction with a vitamin K antagonist which was continued for 90 ± 7 days, with regular dose adjustment to achieve an INR of 2-3. Arixtra was demonstrated to be non-inferior to enoxaparine (VTE rates 3.9% and 4.1% at day 97, respectively). Major bleeding during the initial treatment period was observed in 1.1% of Arixtra patients, compared to 1.2% with enoxaparine.\nPulmonary Embolism (PE): In patients with a confirmed diagnosis of acute symptomatic PE, Arixtra 5 mg (body weight less than 50 kg), 7.5 mg (body weight 50-100 kg) or 10 mg (body weight >100 kg) once daily, was compared to unfractioned heparin (UFH) IV bolus (5000 IU), followed by a continuous IV infusion adjusted to maintain 1.5-2.5 time aPTT control value. Patients were treated for at least 5 days in conjuction with vitamin K antagonist which was continued for 90 ± 7 days, with regular dose adjustment to achieve an INR of 2-3. Arixtra was demonstrated to be non-inferior to UFH (VTE rates 3.8% and 5% at day 97, respectively). Major bleeding during the initial treatment period was observed in 1.3% of Arixtra patients, compared to 1.1% with UFH.\nTreatment of Unstable Angina or Non-ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (UA/NSTEMI): A double-blind, randomised, noninferiority study (OASIS 5) assessed the safety and efficacy of Arixtra 2.5 mg SC once daily versus enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC twice daily in approximately 20,000 patients with UA/NSTEMI. The median treatment duration was 6 days in the Arixtra treatment group and 5 days in the enoxaparin treatment group. The mean age of the patients was 67 years and approximately 60% were at least 65 years. Approximately 40% and 17% of patients had mild [creatinine clearance (CrCl) 50 to <80 mL/min] or moderate (CrCl 30 to <50 mL/min) renal impairment, respectively.\nThe primary adjudicated endpoint was a composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI) and refractory ischaemia (RI) within 9 days of randomisation. Arixtra was as effective as enoxaparin on the primary endpoint. Of the patients treated with Arixtra or enoxaparin, 5.8% and 5.7% of patients, respectively, experienced an event by day 9 (hazard ratio 1.01, 95% CI: 0.9, 1.13, one-sided non-inferiority p-value=0.003).\nThere was a 17% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality in favour of Arixtra by day 30 (Arixtra 2.9%, enoxaparin 3.5%, hazard ratio 0.83, 95% CI: 0.71, 0.97, p=0.02) that was apparent by day 14 (Arixtra 2.1%, enoxaparin 2.4%, hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI: 0.72, 1.04, p=0.14) and sustained to day 180 (Arixtra 5.7%, enoxaparin 6.4%, hazard ratio 0.89, 95% CI: 0.8, 1, p=0.05). The effects of Arixtra and enoxaparin on the incidence of MI and RI were similar at all time points. The efficacy findings were consistent across demographic subgroups, including elderly and renally impaired patients, and across the range of concomitant medications and interventions.\nTreatment with Arixtra was associated with a statistically and clinically significant reduction in the incidence of major bleeding compared to enoxaparin. At day 9, the incidence of major bleeding on Arixtra and enoxaparin was 2.1% and 4.1%, respectively (hazard ratio 0.52, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.61, p<0.001). The lower incidence of major bleeding on Arixtra compared to enoxaparin was also observed consistently across demographic subgroups, including elderly and renally impaired patients and when Arixtra was used concomitantly with aspirin, thienopyridines or GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors.\nIn patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, the incidence of major bleeding at day 9 was similar between Arixtra and enoxaparin (9.7% and 9.8%, respectively).\nTreatment of ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI): OASIS 6 was a double-blind, randomised study assessing the safety and efficacy of fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily versus usual care [placebo (47%) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) (53%)] in approximately 12,000 patients with STEMI. All patients received standard treatments for STEMI, including primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (31%), thrombolytics (45%) or no reperfusion (24%). Of the patients treated with a thrombolytic, 84% were treated with a nonfibrin-specific agent (primarily streptokinase). The mean treatment duration was 6.2 days on fondaparinux. The mean age of the patients was 61 years and approximately 40% were at least 65 years. Approximately 40% and 14% of patients had mild (CrCl =50 to <80 mL/min) or moderate (CrCl =30 to <50 mL/min) renal impairment, respectively.\nThe primary adjudicated endpoint was a composite of death and recurrent MI (re-MI) within 30 days of randomisation. The incidence of death/re-MI at day 30 was significantly reduced from 11.1% for the control group to 9.7% for the fondaparinux group (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI: 0.77, 0.96, p=0.008). In the predefined stratum comparing fondaparinux to placebo [ie, patients treated with nonfibrin-specific lytics (77.3%), no reperfusion (22%), fibrin-specific lytics (0.3%), primary PCI (0.4%)], the incidence of death/re-MI at day 30 was significantly reduced from 14% on placebo to 11.3% (hazard ratio 0.8, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.93, p=0.003). In the predefined stratum comparing fondaparinux to UFH [patients treated with primary PCI (58.5%), fibrin-specific lytics (13%), nonfibrin-specific lytics (2.6%) and no reperfusion (25.9%)], the effects of fondaparinux and UFH on the incidence of death/re-MI at day 30 were not statistically different, respectively, 8.3% versus 8.7% (hazard ratio 0.94, 95% CI: 0.79, 1.11, p=0.46). However, in this stratum, in the subgroup of indicated population undergoing thrombolysis or no reperfusion (ie, patients not undergoing primary PCI), the incidence of death/re-MI at day 30 was significantly reduced from 14.3% on UFH to 11.5% with fondaparinux (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.98, p=0.03).\nThe incidence of all causing mortality at day 30 was also significantly reduced from 8.9% for the control group to 7.8% in the fondaparinux group (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77, 0.98, p=0.02). The difference in mortality was statistically significant in stratum 1 (placebo comparator) but not in stratum 2 (UFH comparator). The mortality benefit shown in the fondaparinux group was maintained until the end of follow-up at day 180.\nIn patients who were revascularised with a thrombolytic, fondaparinux significantly reduced the incidence of death/re-MI at day 30 from 13.6% for the control group to 10.9% (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.93, p=0.003). Among patients initially not reperfused, the incidence of death/re-MI at day 30 was significantly reduced from 15% for the control group to 12.1% for the fondaparinux group (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.97, p=0.023). In patients treated with the primary PCI, the incidence of death/re-MI at day 30 was not statistically different between the 2 groups (6% in fondaparinux group vs 4.8% in the control; hazard ratio 1.26, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.66).\nBy day 9, 1.1% of patients treated with fondaparinux and 1.4% of control patients experienced severe haemorrhage. In patients given a thrombolytic, severe haemorrhage occurred in 1.3% of the fondaparinux patients and in 2% of controls. In patients initially not reperfused, the incidence of severe haemorrhage was 1.2% for fondaparinux versus 1.5% for controls. For patients receiving primary PCI, the incidence of severe haemorrhage was 1% for fondaparinux and 0.4% for controls.\nThe efficacy findings and results on severe haemorrhage were consistent across prespecified subgroups eg, elderly, renally impaired patients, type of concomitant platelet aggregation inhibitors ie, aspirin, thienopyridines.\nPharmacokinetics: Absorption: After SC dosing, fondaparinux is completely and rapidly absorbed (absolute bioavailability 100%). Following a single SC injection of Arixtra 2.5 mg to young healthy subjects, peak plasma concentration (mean Cmax = 0.34 mg/L) is reached in approximately 2 hrs. Plasma concentrations of half the mean Cmax values are reached 25 min post-dosing.\nIn elderly healthy subjects, pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux are linear in the range of 2-8 mg by SC route. Following once-daily dosing, steady-state of plasma levels is obtained after 3-4 days with a 1.3-fold increase in Cmax and AUC. Following a single IV bolus administration to healthy elderly subjects, the pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux are linear over the therapeutic range.\nIn patients undergoing hip replacement surgery receiving Arixtra 2.5 mg SC once daily, the peak steady-state plasma concentration is, on average, 0.39-0.5 mg/L and is reached in approximately 3 hrs post-dose. In these patients, the minimum steady-state plasma concentration is 0.14-0.19 mg/L.\nDistribution: In healthy adults, fondaparinux administered IV or SC distributes mainly in the blood and only to a minor extent in extravascular fluid, as demonstrated by steady-state and non steady-state apparent volume of distribution of 7-11 L. In vitro, fondaparinux is highly (at least 94%) and specifically bound to antithrombin III (ATIII) and does not bind significantly to other plasma proteins, including platelet Factor 4 (PF4) or red blood cells.\nMetabolism: In vivo metabolism of fondaparinux has not been investigated since the majority of the administered dose is eliminated unchanged in the urine in individuals with normal kidney function.\nElimination: Fondaparinux is eliminated in the urine mainly as unchanged drug. In healthy individuals, 64-77% of a single SC or IV dose is eliminated in the urine in 72 hrs. The elimination half-life is about 17 hrs in healthy young subjects and about 21 hrs in healthy elderly subjects. In patients with normal renal function, the mean fondaparinux clearance is 7.82 mL/min.\nSpecial Patient Populations: Renal Impairment: Fondaparinux elimination is prolonged in patients with renal impairment since the major route of elimination is urinary excretion of unchanged drug. In patients undergoing prophylaxis following elective hip surgery or hip fracture surgery, the total clearance of fondaparinux is approximately 25% lower in patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl 50-80 mL/min), approximately 40% lower in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-50 mL/min) and approximately 55% lower in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min), compared to patients with normal renal function. The associated terminal half-life values were 29 hrs in moderate and 72 hrs in patients with severe renal impairment. A similar relationship between fondaparinux clearance and extent of renal impairment was observed in DVT treatment patients.\nHepatic Impairment: Fondaparinux pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.\nChildren: The use of Arixtra has not been investigated in children <17 years.\nElderly: Fondaparinux elimination is prolonged in patients >75 years. In studies evaluating Arixtra 2.5 mg prophylaxis in hip fracture surgery or elective hip surgery, the total clearance of fondaparinux was approximately 25% lower in patients >75 years as compared to patients <65 years. A similar relationship between fondaparinux clearance and age was observed in DVT treatment patients.\nGender: No gender differences were observed after adjustment for body weight.\nRace: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied prospectively. However, studies performed in Asian (Japanese) healthy subjects did not reveal a different pharmacokinetic profile compared to Caucasian healthy subjects. Similarly, based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analysis conducted in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery, no plasma clearance differences were observed between Black and Caucasian patients.\nBody Weight: In patients weighing <50 kg, the total clearance of fondaparinux sodium is decreased by approximately 30% (see Precautions).\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of fondaparinux sodium.\nFondaparinux sodium was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell (L5178Y/TK+/-) forward mutation test, the human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, the rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test or the rat micronucleus test.\nReproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at SC doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 and 12 times human exposure at a dose of 2.5 mg or 2 and 4 times human exposure at a dose of 7.5 mg, based on AUC) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus due to fondaparinux sodium. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Arixtra should not be prescribed to pregnant women unless the risk of VTE outweighs the potential risk to the foetus.",

      "dosage": "General: Before instituting therapy with atorvastatin, an attempt should be made to control hypercholesterolemia with appropriate diet, exercise and weight reduction in obese patients and to treat underlying medical problems. The patients should continue on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet during treatment with atorvastatin.\nUsual Starting Dose: 10 mg once daily. Dosage Range: 10-80 mg once daily.\nDosage may be given any time of the day, with or without food. Starting and maintenance dosage should be individualized according to baseline LDL-C levels, the goal of therapy and patients response. After initiation and/or upon titration of atorvastatin, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2-4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.\nPrimary Hypercholesterolemia and Combined (Mixed) Hyperlipidemia: The majority of patients are controlled with atorvastatin 10 mg once daily. A therapeutic response is evident within 2 weeks and the maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks. The response is maintained during chronic therapy.\nHomozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: In a compassionate-use study of patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, most patients responded to 80 mg of atorvastatin.\nHeterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10-17 years): Recommended Starting Dose: 10 mg/day. Maximum Recommended Dose: 20 mg/day (doses >20 mg have not been studied in this population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy (see Indications and Pharmacodynamics under Actions). Adjustment should be made at intervals of =4 weeks.\nHepatic Insufficiency (see Contraindications and Precautions).\nRenal Insufficiency: Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or on the LDL-C of atorvastatin. Thus, no adjustment of the dose is required.\nChildren: Treatment experience in a pediatric population is limited to doses of atorvastatin up to 80 mg/day for 1 year in patients with homozygous FH. No clinical or biochemical abnormalities were reported in these patients.\nElderly: No differences in safety, efficacy or lipid treatment goal attainment were observed between elderly patients and the overall population (see Actions).\nThe Following Treatment Guidelines may be Used to Establish Treatment Goals (see Table 1):\nAfter the LDL-C goal has been achieved, if the TG is still =200 mg/dL, non HDL-C (total-C minus HDL-C) becomes a secondary target of therapy. Non-HDL-C goals are set 30 mg/dL higher than LDL-C goals for each risk category. (See Table 2.)\nEuropean Atherosclerosis Society (EAS)/Treatment Goals for Lipid Management: For patients with established coronary heart disease or other patients at increased risk of ischemic events, the treatment goal is LDL-C <3 mmol/L (or <115 mg/dL) and total cholesterol <5 mmol/L (or <190 mg/dL).\nCustomary Local Treatment Guidelines (include local guidelines as necessary).",
      "over-dosage": "There is no specific treatment for atorvastatin overdosage.

Women of childbearing potential should use adequate contraceptive measures. Atorvastatin should be administered to women of childbearing age only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards to the fetus.\nAtorvastatin is contraindicated while breastfeeding. It is not knows whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, women taking atorvastatin should not breastfeed.",
      "special-precautions": "Hepatic Effects: As with other lipid-lowering agents of the same class, moderate [>3 x upper limit of normal (ULN)] elevations of serum transaminases have been reported following therapy with atorvastatin. Liver function was monitored during pre-marketing as well as post-marketing clinical studies of atorvastatin given at doses of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg.\nPersistent increases in serum transaminases (>3 x ULN on =2 occasions) occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in these clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg respectively. One (1) patient in clinical trials developed jaundice.\nIncreases in liver function tests (LFT) in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. When the dosage of atorvastatin was reduced or drug treatment interrupted or discontinued, transaminase levels returned to pretreatment levels. Most patients continued treatment on a reduced dose of atorvastatin without sequelae. LFT elevation continued treatment with a reduced dose of atorvastatin.\nLiver function tests should be performed before the initiation of treatment and periodically thereafter. Patients who develop any signs or symptoms suggesting liver injury should have liver function test performed. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored until the abnormality (ies) resolve(s). Should an increase in ALT or AST of >3 times the ULN persist, reduction of dose or withdrawal of atorvastatin is recommended.\nAtorvastatin can cause an elevation in transaminases (see Adverse Reactions).\nAtorvastatin should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of atorvastatin (see Contraindications).\nSkeletal Muscle Effects-Myalgia has been reported in atorvastatin-treated patients (see Adverse Reactions). Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values >10 x ULN, should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevation of CPK.\nPatients should be advised to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise of fever. Atorvastatin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected.\nThe risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, niacin or azole antifungals. Many of these drugs inhibit cytochrome P-450 and 3A4 metabolism and/or drug-transport. Atorvastatin is biotransformed by CYP 3A4. Physicians considering combined therapy with atorvastatin and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, immunosuppressive drugs, azole antifungals or lipid-lowering doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Periodic creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy (see Interactions). Atorvastatin may cause an elevation of CPK (see Adverse Reactions).\nAs with other drugs in this class, rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure, secondary to myoglobinuria has been reported.\nAtorvastatin therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (eg, severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders and uncontrolled seizures).\nPatients should be advised to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.\nAdolescent females and women of childbearing potential should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on atorvastatin therapy (see Use in pregnancy and lactation under Contraindications).\nGeneral: Before instituting therapy with atorvastatin, an attempt should be made to control hypercholesterolemia with appropriate diet, exercise and weight reduction in obese patients and to treat underlying medical problems.\nEffects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: Unknown.",
      "adverse-reactions": "Atorvastatin is generally well-tolerated.

      "interactions": "The risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs in this class in increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, azole antifungals or niacin (see Precautions).\nAntacids: Co-administration of atorvastatin with an oral antacid suspension containing magnesium and alumunium hydroxides, decreased atorvastatin plasma concentrations approximately 35%; however, LDL-C reduction was not altered.\nAntypirine: Because atorvastatin does not affect the pharmacokinetics of antipyrine, interactions with other drugs metabolized via the same cytochrome isozyme are not expected.\nColestipol: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin were lower (approximately 25%) when colestipol was administered with atorvastatin. However, lipid effects were greater when atorvastatin and colestipol were co-administered than when either drug was given alone.\nDigoxin: When multiple doses of digoxin and atorvastatin 10 mg were co-administered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations were unaffected. However, digoxin concentrations increased approximately 20% following administration of digoxin with atorvastatin 80 mg daily. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately.\nErythromycin/Clarithromycin: Co-administration of atorvastatin and erythromycin (500 mg 4 times daily) or clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) known inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4, was associated with higher plasma concentrations of atorvastatin (see Precautions).\nAzithromycin: Co-administration of atorvastatin (10 mg once daily) and azithromycin (500 mg once daily) did not alter the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin.\nTerfenadine: Co-administration of atorvastatin and terfenadine did not produce a clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of terfenadine.\nOral Contraceptives: Co-administration with an oral contraceptive containing norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol increased area under the curve (AUC) values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%. These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.\nWarfarin: An atorvastatin interaction studies with warfarin was conducted and no clinically significant interactions were seen.\nCimetidine: An atorvastatin interaction study with cimetidine was conducted and no clinically significant interactions were seen.\nAmlodipine: Atorvastatin pharmacokinetics were not altered by the co-administration of atorvastatin 80 mg and amlodipine 10 mg at steady state.\nProtease Inhibitors: Co-administration of atorvastatin and protease inhibitors, known inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4, was associated with increased plasma concentrations of atorvastatin.\nOther Concomitant Therapy: In clinical studies, atorvastatin was used concomitantly with antihypertensive agents and estrogen replacement therapy without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. Interaction studies with specific agents have not been conducted.\nEndocrine Function: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal and/or gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor as administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones eg, ketoconazole, spironolactone and cimetidine.",

      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: Atorvastatin calcium is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent, which is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early and rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.\nMechanism of Action: Atorvastatin is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. In patients with homozygous and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia, atorvastatin reduces total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apo B). Atorvastatin also reduces very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) and produces variable increases in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Triglycerides and cholesterol in the liver are incorporated into VLDL and released into the plasma for delivery to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from VLDL and is catabolized primarily through the high affinity LDL receptor. Like LDL, cholesterol–enriched triglyceride–rich lipoproteins, including VLDL, IDL and remnants can also promote artherosclerosis. Elevated plasma triglycerides are frequently found in a trial with low HDL-C levels and small LDL particles, as well as in association with non-lipid metabolic risk factors for coronary heart disease. As such total plasma TG has inconsistently been shown to be and independent risk factor for CHD. Furthermore, the independent effect of raising HDL or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.\nAtorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface for enhanced uptake and catabolism of LDL.",

Unless otherwise prescribed, the following dosages are recommended: Adults and Children =12 years: 2 metered doses (puffs) 4 times daily.\nSince a requirement for increasing doses suggests that additional therapeutic modalities may be needed, a total daily dose of 12 puffs should generally not be exceeded.\nIf therapy does not produce a significant improvement or if the patient's condition gets worse, medical advice must be sought in order to determine a new plan of treatment. In the case of acute or rapidly worsening dyspnoea (difficulty in breathing), a doctor should be consulted immediately.\nFor acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, treatment with Atrovent inhalation solution or unit dose vials may be indicated.\nBecause of insufficient information in children, Atrovent metered-aerosol should only be used on medical advice and under the supervision of an adult.\nInhalation Solution: The dosage should be adapted to the individual requirements of the patient. Patients should also be kept under medical supervision during treatment. Unless otherwise prescribed, the following doses are recommended: Adults (Including the Elderly) and Adolescents >14 years: 0.4-2 mL (8-40 drops=0.1-0.5 mg) 3-4 times daily. Children 6-14 years: 0.4-1 mL (8-20 drops=0.1-0.25 mg) 3-4 times daily.\nThe recommended dose is to be diluted with physiological saline to a final volume of 3-4 mL and nebulised and inhaled until the solution is consumed. The solution should be rediluted each time before use; any residual diluted solution should be discarded.\nDosage may be dependent upon the mode of inhalation and the quality of nebulisation. In the case of particle sizes up to 5 micrometer or with assisted ventilation, dose levels may be reduced to approximately 0.4 mL (8 drops=0.1 mg). The duration of inhalation can be controlled by the dilution volume.\nThe dose may be repeated after intervals of at least 4 hrs, if required.\nDaily doses exceeding 2 mg should be given under medical supervision.\nPatients should be advised to consult a physician or the nearest hospital immediately in the case of acute or rapidly worsening dyspnoea (difficulty in breathing) if additional inhalations do not produce an adequate improvement.

Breathe out deeply. Hold the metered aerosol and close lips over the mouthpiece. The arrow and the base of the container should be pointing upwards. Breathe in as deeply as possible, pressing the base of the container firmly at the same time; this releases 1 metered dose. Hold breath for a few seconds, then remove mouthpiece from the mouth and breathe out. The same action should be repeated for a 2nd inhalation. Replace the protective cap after use.\nAfter not using the metered aerosol for 3 days, the valve has to be actuated once.\nThe container is not transparent. It is not therefore possible to see when it is empty. The aerosol will deliver 200 doses. When these have all been used, the aerosol may still appear to contain a small amount of fluid.

Thus, patients must be instructed in the correct administration of Atrovent metered aerosol.\nEye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema may be signs of acute narrow-angle glaucoma. Should any combination of these symptoms develop, treatment with miotic drops should be initiated and specialist advice sought immediately.\nPatients must be instructed of the correct administration of Atrovent solution for inhalation. Care must be taken not to allow the solution or mist to enter into the eyes. It is recommended that the nebulised solution is administered via a mouth piece. If this is not available and a nebuliser mask is used, it must fit properly. Patients who may be predisposed to glaucoma should be warned specifically to protect their eyes.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: The safety of Atrovent during human pregnancy has not been established. The benefits of using Atrovent during a confirmed or suspected pregnancy must be weighed against possible hazards to the unborn child. Preclinical studies have shown no embryotoxic or teratogenic effects following inhalation or intranasal application at doses considerably higher than those recommended in man.\nIt is not known whether Atrovent is excreted in breast milk. Although lipid-insoluble quaternary cations pass into breast milk, it is unlikely that Atrovent would reach the infant to an important extent, when administered by inhalation. However, because many drugs are excreted in breast milk, caution should be exercised when Atrovent is administered to nursing mothers.\nUse in children: Safety and effectiveness in children <12 years have not been established.\nSide Effects The most frequent nonrespiratory adverse events reported in clinical trials were Gastrointestinal motility disorders (eg, constipation, diarrhea and vomiting), dryness of the mouth and headache.\nFurther, the following side effects have been observed with Atrovent: Increased heart rate, palpitations, supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, ocular accommodation disturbances, nausea and urinary retention. These side effects have been reversible. The risk of urinary retention may be increased in patients with preexisting outflow tract obstruction.\nOcular side effects have been reported (see Precautions).\nAs with other inhaled therapy including bronchodilators, cough, local irritation and inhalation-induced bronchoconstriction have been observed.\nAllergic-type reactions eg, skin rash, angioedema of the tongue, lips and face, urticaria (including giant urticaria), laryngospasm and anaphylactic reactions have been reported, with positive rechallenge in some cases.",

Anticholinergics prevent the increase in intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) caused by interaction of acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptor on bronchial smooth muscle.\nThe bronchodilation following inhalation of Atrovent is induced by a local drug concentration sufficient for anticholinergic efficacy at the bronchial smooth muscle and not by systemic drug concentrations.\nIn controlled 90-day studies in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis and emphysema), significant improvements in pulmonary function (FEV1 and FEF25-75% increases of =15%) occurred within 15 min, reached a peak in 1-2 hrs, and persisted in the majority of patients up to 6 hrs.\nPreclinical and clinical evidence suggest no deleterious effect of ipratropium bromide on airway mucous secretion, mucociliary clearance or gas exchange.\nThe bronchodilator effect of ipratropium bromide in the treatment of acute bronchospasm associated with asthma has been shown in studies in adults and children >6 years. In most of these studies ipratropium bromide was administered in combination with an inhaled ß-agonist.\nData are limited to show that ipratropium bromide has a therapeutic effect in the treatment of bronchospasm associated with viral bronchiolitis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in infants and very small children.",

These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity. If an allergic reaction occurs, amoxicillin-clavulanate therapy should be discontinued and appropriate alternative therapy instituted. Serious anaphylactoid reactions require immediate emergency treatment with adrenaline. Oxygen IV steroids and airway management, including intubation may also be required.\nAmoxicillin-clavulanate should be avoided if infectious mononucleosis is suspected since the occurrence of a morbilliform rash has been associated with this condition following the use of amoxicillin.\nProlonged use may also occasionally result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms.\nIn general, amoxicillin-clavulanate is well tolerated and possesses the characteristic low toxicity of the penicillin group of antibiotics. Periodic assessment of organ system functions, including renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function is advisable during prolonged therapy.\nProlongation of prothrombin time has been reported rarely in patients receiving amoxicillin-clavulanate. Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are prescribed concomitantly.\nChanges in liver function tests have been observed in some patients receiving Augmentin. The clinical significance of these changes is uncertain but Augmentin should be used with caution in patients with evidence of hepatic dysfunction.\nIn patients with renal impairment, dosage should be adjusted according to the degree of implement (see Renal Impairment under Dosage and Administration).\nIn patients with reduced urine output, crystalluria has been observed very rarely, predominantly with parenteral therapy.

      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Amoxicillin-clavulanate (ß-lactam antibacterial penicillin co-formulated with a ß-lactamase inhibitor) is an antibiotic agent with a notably broad spectrum of activity against the commonly occurring bacterial pathogens in general practice and hospital. The ß-lactamase inhibitory action of clavulanate extends the spectrum of amoxicillin to embrace a wider range of organisms, including many resistant to other ß-lactam antibiotics.\nPharmacodynamics: Mechanism of Action: Amoxicillin is a semisynthetic antibiotic with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Amoxicillin is, however, susceptible to degradation by ß-lactamases and therefore the spectrum of activity of amoxicillin alone does not include organisms which produce these enzymes.\nClavulanic acid is a ß-lactam, structurally related to penicillins, which possesses the ability to inactivate a wide range of ß-lactamase enzymes commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. In particular, it has good activity against the clinically important plasmid-mediated ß-lactamases frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance. It is generally less effective against chromosomally-mediated type 1 ß-lactamases.\nThe presence of clavulanic acid in amoxicillin-clavulanate formulations protects amoxicillin from degradation by ß-lactamase enzymes and effectively extends the antibacterial spectrum of amoxicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to amoxicillin and other penicillins and cephalosporins. Thus, amoxicillin-clavulanate possesses the distinctive properties of a broad-spectrum antibiotic and a ß-lactamase inhibitor.\nMicrobiology: Amoxicillin-clavulanate is bactericidal to a wide range of organisms including:\nGram-Positive: Aerobes: Bacillus anthracis*, Corynebacterium spp, Enterococcus faecalis*, Enterococcus faecium*, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus*, coagulase-negative staphylococci* (Staphylococcus epidermidis*), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus spp, Streptococcus viridans*.\nGram-Positive: Anaerobes: Clostridium spp, Peptococcus spp, Peptostreptococcus spp.\nGram-Negative: Aerobes: Bordetella pertussis, Brucella spp, Escherichia coli*, Gardnerella vaginalis, Haemophilus influenzae*, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella spp*, Legionella spp, Moraxella catarrhalis* (Branhamella catarrhalis), Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, Neisseria meningitidis*, Pasteurella multocida, Proteus mirabilis*, Proteus vulgaris*, Salmonella spp*, Shigella spp*, Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterolitica*.\nGram-Negative Anaerobes: Bacteroides spp* (including Bacteroides fragilis), Fusobacterium spp*.\nNote: *Some members of these species produce ß-lactamase, rendering them insensitive to amoxicillin alone.\nPharmacokinetics: Absorption: The 2 components of amoxicillin-clavulanate, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid are fully dissociated in aqueous solution at physiological pH. Both components are rapidly and well absorbed by the oral route of administration. Absorption of amoxicillin-clavulanate is optimized when taken at the start of the meal. Amoxicillin serum concentrations achieved with amoxicillin-clavulanate are similar to those produced by the oral administration of equivalent doses of amoxicillin alone.\nDistribution: Following IV administration, therapeutic concentrations of both amoxicillin and clavulanic acid may be detected in the tissues and interstitial fluid. Therapeutic concentrations of both drugs have been found in gallbladder, abdominal tissues, skin, fat and muscle tissues; fluids found to have therapeutic levels include synovial and peritoneal fluids, bile and pus.\nNeither amoxicillin nor clavulanic acid is highly protein bound, studies show that about 25% for clavulanic acid and 18% for amoxicillin of total plasma drug content is bound to protein. From animal studies, there is no evidence to suggest that either component accumulates in any organ.\nAmoxicillin, like most penicillins, can be detected in breast milk. Trace quantities of clavulanate can also be detected in breast milk. With the exception of the risk of sensitization associated with this excretion, there are no known detrimental effects for the breastfed infant.\nReproduction studies in animals have shown that both amoxicillin and clavulanic acid penetrate the placental barrier. However, no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus was detected.\nMetabolism: Amoxicillin is partly excreted in the urine as the inactive penicilloic acid in quantities equivalent to 10-25% of the initial dose. Clavulanic acid is extensively metabolized in man to 2,5-dihydro-4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-5-oxo-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid and 1-amino-4-hydroxy-butan-2-one and eliminated in urine and feces as carbon dioxide in expired air.\nElimination: As with other penicillins, the major route of elimination for amoxicillin is via the kidney, whereas for clavulanate, it is by both renal and non-renal mechanisms.\nApproximately 60-70% of the amoxicillin and approximately 40-65% of the clavulanic acid are excreted unchanged in the urine during the 1st 6 hrs after administration of a single 250/125 mg or a single 500/125 mg tablet.\nConcomitant use of probenecid delays amoxicillin excretion but does not delay renal excretion of clavulanic acid (see Interactions).\nNon-Clinical Information: No further information of relevance.",

(See Pharmacokinetics under Actions.)\nHepatic Impairment: No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions and Precautions).\nAdministration: Avamys nasal spray is for administration by the intranasal route only.\nThe intranasal device should be shaken before use. The device is primed by pressing the mist release button for at least 6 spray actuations (until a fine mist is seen), whilst holding the device upright. The device should be cleansed after each use and the cap replaced.",
      "over-dosage": "Symptoms: In a bioavailability study, intranasal doses of up to 24 times the recommended daily adult dose were studied over 3 days with no adverse systemic effects observed (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions).\nTreatment: Acute overdose is unlikely to require any therapy other than observation.",
      "contra-indications": "Patients with hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of Avamys nasal spray.",
      "special-precautions": "Fluticasone furoate undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism by the liver enzyme CYP3A4, therefore the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate in patients with severe liver disease may be altered (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions and Interactions). Based on data with another glucocorticoid metabolized by CYP3A4, co-administration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the potential risk of increased systemic exposure to fluticasone furoate (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions and Interactions).\nSystemic effects of nasal corticosteroid may occur, particularly at high doses prescribed for prolonged periods. These effects vary between patients and different corticosteroids. Treatment with higher than the recommended doses of nasal corticosteroids may result in clinically significant adrenal suppression. If there is evidence for higher than recommended doses being used, then additional systemic corticosteroid cover should be considered during periods of stress or elective surgery. Fluticasone furoate 110 mcg once daily was not associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression in adult, adolescent or pediatric subjects. However, the dose of intranasal fluticasone furoate should be reduced to the lowest dose at which effective control of the symptoms of rhinitis is maintained. As with all intranasal corticosteroids, the total systemic burden of corticosteroids should be considered whenever other forms of corticosteroid treatment are prescribed concurrently.\nGrowth retardation has been reported in children receiving some nasal corticosteroids at licensed doses. It is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with nasal corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be reviewed with the aim of reducing the dose of nasal corticosteroid if possible, to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained.\nIn addition, consideration should be given to referring the patient to a pediatric specialist. If there is any reason to believe that adrenal function is impaired, care must be taken when transferring patients from systemic steroid treatment to fluticasone furoate.\nNasal or inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma and/or cataracts.\nAvamys nasal spray contains benzalkonium chloride. It may cause irritation of the nasal mucosa.\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: Based on the pharmacology of fluticasone furoate and other intranasally administered steroids, there is no reason to expect an effect on the ability to drive or to operate machinery with Avamys nasal spray.\nImpairment of Fertility: There are no data in humans (see Toxicology under Actions).\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: Adequate data are not available regarding the use of Avamys nasal spray during pregnancy and lactation in humans. Avamys nasal spray should be used in pregnancy only if the benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.\nFollowing intranasal administration of fluticasone furoate at the maximum recommended human dose (110 mcg/day), plasma fluticasone furoate concentrations were typically non-quantifiable and therefore potential for reproductive toxicity is expected to be very low (see Toxicology under Actions).\nThe excretion of fluticasone furoate into human breast milk has not been investigated. Administration of fluticasone furoate to women who are breastfeeding should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the child.",
      "adverse-reactions": "Data from large clinical trials were used to determine the frequency of adverse reactions. The following convention has been used for the classification of frequency: Very common (>1/10); common (>1/100 and <1/10); uncommon (>1/1000 and <1/100); rare (>1/10,000 and <1/1000); very rare (<1/10,000).\nClinical Trial Data: Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Very Common: Epistaxis.\nIn adults and adolescents, the incidence of epistaxis was higher in longer-term use (>6 weeks) than in short-term use (up to 6 weeks). In paediatric clinical studies of up to 12-weeks duration, the incidence of epistaxis was similar between Avamys nasal spray and placebo.\nCommon: Nasal ulceration.\nSystemic effects of nasal corticosteroids may occur, particularly when prescribed at high doses for prolonged periods.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "Fluticasone furoate is rapidly cleared by extensive first-pass metabolism mediated by the cytochrome P-450 3A4. Based on data with another glucocorticoid (fluticasone propionate) that is metabolized by CYP3A4, co-administration with ritonavir is not recommended because of the risk of increased systemic exposure of fluticasone furoate. Caution is recommended when co-administering fluticasone furoate with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors as an increase in systemic exposure cannot be ruled out. In a drug interaction study of fluticasone furoate with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole, there were more subjects with measurable fluticasone furoate plasma concentrations in the ketoconazole group (6 of the 20 subjects) compared to placebo (1 of the 20 subjects). This small increase in exposure did not result in a statistically significant difference in 24-hr serum cortisol levels between the 2 groups. The enzyme induction and inhibition data suggest that there is no theoretical basis for anticipating metabolic interactions between fluticasone furoate and the cytochrome P-450-mediated metabolism of other compounds at clinically relevant intranasal doses. Therefore, no clinical studies have been conducted to investigate interactions of fluticasone furoate on other drugs (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions and Precautions).\nIncompatibilities: None.",
      "pregnancy-safe": "Category C: Either studies in animals have revealed adverse effects on the foetus (teratogenic or embryocidal or other) and there are no controlled studies in women or studies in women and animals are not available. Drugs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.\nCaution For Usage Instructions for Use/Handling: Once the device has been primed (approximately 6 sprays), each spray delivers fluticasone furoate 27.5 mcg. Re-priming is only necessary if the cap is left off for 5 days or the nasal spray has not been used for =30 days.\nNasal Spray: Avamys nasal spray comes in a glass bottle inside a plastic casing. A window on the side of the casing allows seeing how much medicine is left. The medicine sprays out of the nozzle when the button on the side is firmly pressed. The nozzle is protected by a removable cap.\nTesting the Nasal Spray: In using the nasal spray for the first time, it must be tested if it is working properly. If the cap has been left off or the patient have not used the spray for nearly a month, test it again.\n1. With the cap on, shake the nasal spray.\n2. Remove the cap by gently squeezing the sides of the cap with the thumb and forefinger and pull it straight off.\n3. Point the nozzle away and firmly press the button on the side at least 6 times to release a fine spray into the air.\n4. The nasal spray is now ready for use.\nIf the nasal spray was dropped accidentally, check for damage and test it again. If the spray is damaged, if it produces anything other than a fine mist (eg, a jet of liquid), or if discomfort is felt while using the spray, return it to the pharmacist.\nHow to Use the Nasal Spray: Blow the nose before using the spray to clear the nostrils. Shake the spray gently before each use.\n1. Tilt the head forward a little bit.\n2. Hold the nasal spray upright and carefully place the nozzle in 1 of the nostrils.\n3. Point the end of the nozzle toward the outside of the nose, away from the center ridge of the nose. This helps get the medicine to the right part of the nose.\n4. Breathe in through the nose while firmly pressing the button once to spray the medicine in the nose. Be careful not to spray into the eyes. If it does, rinse the eyes with water.\n5. Take the nozzle out and breathe through the mouth.\n6. Repeat the previous 5 steps for the other nostril.\n7. If the physician advised to get 2 sprays per nostril, repeat all the 6 previous steps.\nCleaning the Nasal Spray: 1. After each use, wipe the nozzle and the inside of the cap. Do not use water, wipe with a clean, dry tissue.\n2. Always replace the cap once finished and keep it out of dust.\nIf the Patient Forgets to Use Avamys Nasal Spray: If the patient missed a dose, take it as soon as remembered. If it is nearly time for the next dose, wait until then. Do not take a double dose.",

      "description": "Avamys nasal spray is a white, uniform suspension contained in an amber glass bottle, fitted with a metering (50 microliter) atomizing spray pump. The inner pack is incorporated within a predominantly off-white plastic device with a blue side-actuated lever and a lid which contains a stopper. Each spray of the suspension delivers approximately 27.5 mcg of micronized fluticasone furoate as an ex-device dose.",
      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Mechanism of Action: Fluticasone furoate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid that possesses a very high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and has a potent anti-inflammatory action.\nPharmacokinetics: Absorption: Fluticasone furoate undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism and incomplete absorption in the liver and gut resulting in negligible systemic exposure. The intranasal dosing of 110 mcg once daily does not typically result in measurable plasma concentrations (<10 pg/mL). The absolute bioavailability for fluticasone furoate administered as 880 mcg 3 times daily (2640 mcg total daily dose) is 0.5%.\nDistribution: The plasma protein-binding of fluticasone furoate is >99%. Fluticasone furoate is widely distributed with volume of distribution at steady state of, on average, 608 L.\nMetabolism: Fluticasone furoate is rapidly cleared (total plasma clearance of 58.7 L/hr) from systemic circulation principally by hepatic metabolism to an inactive 17ß-carboxylic metabolite (GW694301X) by the cytochrome P-450 enzyme CYP3A4. The principal route of metabolism was hydrolysis of the S-fluoromethyl carbothioate function to form 17ß-carboxylic acid metabolite. In vivo studies have revealed no evidence of cleavage of the furoate moiety to form fluticasone.\nElimination: Elimination was primarily via the fecal route following oral and IV administration indicative of excretion of fluticasone furoate and its metabolites via the bile. Following IV administration, the elimination phase half-life averaged 15.1 hrs. Urinary excretion accounted for approximately 1% and 2% of the orally and IV administered dose, respectively.\nSpecial Patient Populations: Elderly: Only a small number of elderly subjects (n=23/872; 2.6%) provided pharmacokinetic data. There was no evidence for a higher incidence of subjects with quantifiable fluticasone furoate concentrations in the elderly, when compared to younger subjects.\nChildren: Fluticasone furoate is typically not quantifiable (<10 pg/mL) following intranasal dosing of 110 mcg once daily. Quantifiable levels were observed in <16% of pediatric patients following intranasal dosing of 110 mcg once daily and only <7% of pediatric patients following 55 mcg once daily. There was no evidence for a higher incidence of quantifiable levels of fluticasone furoate in younger children (<6 years).\nRenal Impairment: Fluticasone furoate is not detectable in urine from healthy volunteers after intranasal dosing. Less than 1% of dose-related material is excreted in urine and therefore renal impairment would not be expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of fluticasone furoate.\nHepatic Impairment: A study of a single 400-mcg dose of orally inhaled fluticasone furoate in patients with moderate hepatic impairment resulted in increased Cmax (42%) and AUC(0-8) (172%) and a modest (on average 23%) decrease in cortisol levels in patients compared to healthy subjects. From this study, the average predicted exposure for intranasal fluticasone furoate 110 mcg in patients with moderate hepatic impairment would not be expected to result in suppression of cortisol. Therefore, moderate hepatic impairment is not predicted to result in a clinically relevant effect for the normal adult dose. There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The exposure of fluticasone furoate is likely to be further increased in such patients.\nOthers: Fluticasone furoate is typically not quantifiable (<10 pg/mL) following intranasal dosing of 110 mcg once daily. Quantifiable levels were only observed in <31% of patients =12 years and in <16% of pediatric patients following intranasal dosing of 110 mcg once daily. There was no evidence for gender, age (including pediatrics) or race to be related to those subjects with quantifiable levels, when compared to those without.\nClinical Studies: Adult and Adolescent Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis: Avamys nasal spray 110 mcg once daily resulted in a significant improvement in daily reflective (how patient felt over the preceding 12 hrs) and instantaneous (how patient felt at the time of assessment) pre-dose total nasal symptom scores (rTNSS and iTNSS, comprising rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing and nasal itching) and daily reflective and instantaneous total ocular symptom scores (rTOSS, comprising itching/burning, tearing/watering and redness of the eyes) versus placebo (see table). The improvement in nasal and ocular symptoms was maintained over the full 24 hrs after once-daily administration. (See table.)\nThe distribution of the patients' perception of overall response to therapy (using a 7-point scale ranging from significantly improved to significantly worse) favoured Avamys nasal spray 110 mcg over placebo, with a statistically significant treatment difference. Onset of action was experienced as early as 8 hrs after initial administration in 2 studies. Significant improvement in symptoms was observed in the first 24 hrs in all 4 studies and continued to improve over several days. The patients' quality of life (as assessed by the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire - RQLQ), was significantly improved from baseline with Avamys nasal spray as compared to placebo. (Minimum Important Difference in all studies = improvement of at least -0.5 over placebo; treatment difference -0.69, p<0.001, 95%CI -0.84, -0.54).\nAdult and Adolescent Perennial Allergic Rhinitis: Avamys nasal spray 110 mcg once daily resulted in a significant improvement in daily rTNSS (LS mean difference = -0.706, p=0.005, 95%CI -1.2, -0.21). The improvement in nasal symptoms was maintained over the full 24 hrs after once-daily administration. The distribution of patients' perception of overall response to therapy was also significantly improved compared to placebo.\nChildren: The pediatric posology is based on assessment of the efficacy data across the allergic rhinitis population in children. In a seasonal allergic rhinitis study in children, Avamys nasal spray 110 mcg over 2 weeks was effective on primary (daily rTNSS LS mean difference = -0.616, p=0.025, 95%CI -1.15, -0.08) and all secondary nasal endpoints, except the individual reflective score for rhinorrhea and nasal congestion. No significant differences were observed between Avamys nasal spray 55 mcg and placebo on any endpoint. In a perennial allergic rhinitis study, Avamys nasal spray 55 mcg was effective on daily rTNSS (LS mean difference = -0.754, p=0.003, 95%CI -1.24, -0.27). Although there was a trend towards improvement in rTNSS in 100 mcg, this did not reach statistical significance (LS mean difference = -0.452, p=0.073, 95%CI, -1.24, -0.04). Post-hoc analysis of efficacy data over 6 and 12 weeks from this study and a 6-week HPA-axis safety study, supported the efficacy of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 mcg once daily. A 6-week study that assessed the effect of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 mcg once daily on adrenal function in children 2-11 years showed that there was no significant effect on 24-hr serum cortisol profiles, compared with placebo. Results from a placebo-controlled knemometry study of Avamys nasal spray 110 mcg once daily observed no clinically relevant effects on short-term lower leg growth rate in children.\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity: There were no treatment-related increase in the incidence of tumours in 2-year inhalation studies in rats and mice. Fluticasone furoate was not genotoxic in vitro or in vivo.\nReproductive Toxicology: The potential for reproductive toxicity was assessed in animals by inhalation administration to ensure high systemic exposure to fluticasone furoate. There were no effects on mating performance or fertility of male or female rats. In rats, developmental toxicity was confined to an increased incidence of incompletely ossified sternabrae in association with lower fetal weight. High doses in rabbits induced abortion. These findings are typical following systemic exposure to potent corticosteroids. There were no major skeletal or visceral abnormalities in either rats or rabbits, and no effect on pre- or postnatal development in rats.\nAnimal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology: Findings in general toxicology studies were similar to those observed with other glucocorticoids and are not considered to be clinically relevant to intranasal use of fluticasone furoate.",

Dutasteride has not been studied in women because preclinical data suggest that the suppression of circulating levels of dihydrotestosterone may inhibit the development of the external genital organs in a male fetus carried by a woman exposed to dutasteride.\nIt is not known whether dutasteride is excreted in breast milk.",
      "special-precautions": "Combination therapy should be prescribed after careful benefit risk assessment due to the potential increased risk of adverse events and after consideration of alternative treatment options including monotherapies (see Dosage and Administration).\nIn two 4-year clinical studies, the incidence of cardiac failure (a composite term of reported events, primarily cardiac failure and congestive cardiac failure) was higher among subjects taking the combination of Avodart and an a-blocker, primarily tamsulosin, than it was among subjects not taking the combination. In these two trials, the incidence of cardiac failure was low (=1%) and variable between the studies. No imbalance was observed in the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events overall in either trial. No causal relationship between Avodart (alone or in combination with an alpha blocker) and cardiac failure has been established (See Clinical Studies under Actions).\nDigital rectal examination, as well as other evaluations for prostate cancer, must be performed on patients with Blood PressureH prior to initiating therapy with Avodart and periodically thereafter.\nDutasteride is absorbed through the skin; therefore, women, children and adolescents must avoid contact with leaking capsules (see Use in pregnancy and lactation under Contraindication). If contact is made with leaking capsules, the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water.\nDutasteride was not studied in patients with liver disease. Caution should be used in the administration of dutasteride to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see Dosage and Administration, Contraindications, and Pharmacokinetics under Actions).\nSerum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration is an important component in the detection of prostate cancer. Generally, a total serum PSA concentration >4 ng/mL (Hybritech) requires further evaluation and consideration of prostate biopsy. Physicians should be aware that a baseline PSA <4 ng/mL in patients taking Avodart does not exclude a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Avodart causes a decrease in serum PSA levels by approximately 50% after 6 months, in patients with Blood PressureH, even in the presence of prostate cancer. Although there may be individual variation, the reduction in PSA by approximately 50% is predictable as it was observed over the entire range of baseline PSA values (1.5-10 ng/mL). Therefore, to interpret an isolated PSA value in a man treated with Avodart for =6 months, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. This adjustment preserves the sensitivity and specificity of the PSA assay and maintains its ability to detect prostate cancer.\nAny sustained increases in PSA levels while on Avodart should be carefully evaluated, including consideration of non-compliance to therapy with Avodart.\nTotal serum PSA levels return to baseline within 6 months of discontinuing treatment.\nThe ratio of free to total PSA remains constant even under the influence of Avodart. If clinicians elect to use percent-free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing Avodart therapy, no adjustment to its value is necessary.\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: Based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of dutasteride, treatment would not be expected to interfere with the ability to drive or operate machinery.\nImpairment of Fertility: The effects of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day on semen characteristics were evaluated in normal volunteers 18-52 years (n=27 dutasteride, n=23 placebo) throughout 52 weeks of treatment and 24 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. At 52 weeks, the mean percent reduction from baseline in total sperm count, semen volume and sperm motility were 23%, 26% and 18%, respectively, in the dutasteride group when adjusted for changes from baseline in the placebo group. Sperm concentration and morphology were unaffected. After 24 weeks of follow-up, the mean percentage change in total sperm count in the dutasteride group remained 23% lower than baseline. While mean values for all semen parameters at all time points remained within normal ranges and did not meet predefined criteria for a clinically significant change (30%), 2 subjects in the dutasteride group had decreases in sperm count of >90% from baseline at 52 weeks with partial recovery at the 24-week follow-up. The clinical significance of dutasteride's effect on semen characteristics for an individual patient's fertility is not known.",
      "adverse-reactions": "Clinical Trial Data: Avodart Monotherapy: Approximately 19% of the 2167 patients who received dutasteride in the 2-year Phase III placebo-controlled trials developed adverse reactions during the 1st year of treatment. The majority of events were mild to moderate and occurred in the reproductive system. No change to the adverse event profile was apparent over a further 2 years in open-label extension studies.\nTable 1 shows adverse reactions from controlled clinical trials and post-marketing experience. The listed adverse events from clinical trials are investigator-judged drug-related events (with incidence =1%) reported with a higher incidence in patients treated with dutasteride compared with placebo during the 1st year of treatment. Adverse events from post-marketing experience were identified from spontaneous post-marketing reports, therefore, the true incidence is unknown.\nAvodart and Tamsulosin Combination Therapy for Blood PressureH: The following investigator-judged drug-related adverse events (with a cumulative incidence of =1%) have been reported in the CombAT (combination of Avodart and tamsulosin) study, a comparison of Avodart 0.5 mg and tamsulosin 0.4 mg once daily for 4 years in combination or as monotherapy. (See Table 2.)\nPost-Marketing Data: Adverse drug reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as: Very common (=1/10), common (=1/100 and <1/10), uncommon (=1/1000 and <1/100), rare (=1/10,000 and <1/1000) and very rare (<1/10,000) including isolated reports. Frequency categories determined from post-marketing data refer to reporting rate rather than true frequency.\nImmune System Disorders: Very Rare: Allergic reactions, including rash, pruritus, urticaria, localised oedema and angioedema.\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Rare: Alopecia (primary body hair loss), hypertrichosis.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "For information on the decreased serum PSA levels during treatment with dutasteride and guidance concerning prostate cancer detection see Precautions.\nEffects of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Dutasteride: Use Together with CYP3A4 and/or P-Glycoprotein-Inhibitors: Dutasteride is mainly eliminated via metabolism. In vitro studies indicate that this metabolism is catalysed by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. No formal interaction studies have been performed with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. However, in a population pharmacokinetic study, dutasteride serum concentration were on average 1.6-1.8 times greater, respectively, in a small number of patients treated concurrently with verapamil or diltiazem (moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 and inhibitors of P-glycoprotein) than in other patients.\nLong-term combination of dutasteride with drugs that are potent inhibitors of the enzyme CYP3A4 (eg, ritonavir, indinavir, nefazodone, itraconazole, ketoconazole administered orally) may increase serum concentrations of dutasteride. Further inhibition of 5a-reductase at increased dutasteride exposure, is not likely. However, a reduction of the dutasteride dosing frequency can be considered if side effects are noted. It should be noted that in the case of enzyme inhibition, the long t½ may be further prolonged and it can take >6 months of concurrent therapy before a new steady-state is reached.\nAdministration of cholestyramine 12 g 1 hr before a 5 mg single-dose of dutasteride did not affect the pharmacokinetics of dutasteride.\nEffects of Dutasteride on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs: Dutasteride has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin or digoxin. This indicates that dutasteride does not inhibit/induce CYP2C9 or the transporter P-glycoprotein. In vitro interaction studies indicate that dutasteride does not inhibit the enzyme CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4.\nIn a small study (N=24) of 2 weeks duration in healthy men, dutasteride (0.5 mg daily) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tamsulosin or terazosin. There was also no indication of a pharmacodynamic interaction in this study.",
      "pregnancy-safe": "Category X: Studies in animals or human beings have demonstrated foetal abnormalities or there is evidence of foetal risk based on human experience or both, and the risk of the use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweighs any possible benefit. The drug is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant.\nCaution For Usage Instructions for Use/Handling: Dutasteride is absorbed through the skin; therefore, women and children must avoid contact with leaking capsules (see Use in pregnancy and lactation under Contraindications). If contact is made with leaking capsules, the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water.",

      "description": "Each capsule also contains the following excipients: Capsule Contents: Monodiglycerides of caprylic/capric acid and butylated hydroxytoluene.\nCapsule Shell: Gelatin, glycerol, titanium dioxide (E171, CI 77891), yellow iron oxide (E172, CI 77492), red printing ink containing red iron oxide (E172, CI 77491) as the colourant, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and medium chain triglycerides and lecithin as capsule lubricants.",
      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: Dutasteride is a dual inhibitor of 5a-reductase. It inhibits both type 1 and type 2, 5a-reductase isoenzymes, which are responsible for the conversion of testosterone to 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is the androgen primarily responsible for hyperplasia of glandular prostatic tissue.\nEffects on DHT/Testosterone: The maximum effect of daily doses of Avodart on the reduction of DHT is dose-dependent and is observed within 1-2 weeks. After 1 week and 2 weeks of daily dosing of Avodart 0.5 mg, median serum DHT concentrations were reduced by 85% and 90%, respectively.\nIn benign prostatic hyperplasia (Blood PressureH) patients treated with 0.5 mg of dutasteride daily, the median decrease in DHT was 94% at 1 year and 93% at 2 years and the median increase in serum testosterone was 19% at both 1 and 2 years. This is an expected consequence of 5a-reductase inhibition and did not result in any known adverse events.\nClinical Studies: Avodart Monotherapy: Dutasteride 0.5 mg/day or placebo was evaluated in 4325 male subjects with enlarged prostates (>30 cc) in 3 primary efficacy 2-year multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies.\nIn men with Blood PressureH, Avodart treats and prevents disease progression by reducing the risk of both acute urinary retention (AUR) and the need for surgical intervention (SI) and by providing statistically significant improvement of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) and prostate volume relative to placebo. These improvements in LUTS, Qmax and prostate volume were seen in the course of 24 months, and LUTS and Qmax continued to improve for a further 2 years in open-label extension studies. In addition, reductions in prostate volume were sustained for a further 2 years in open-label extension studies.\nAvodart and Tamsulosin Combination Therapy: Avodart 0.5 mg/day, tamsulosin 0.4 mg/day or the combination of Avodart 0.5 mg plus tamsulosin 0.4 mg was evaluated in 4844 male subjects with enlarged prostates =30 cc) in a multicenter, double blind, parallel group study over 2 years. The primary efficacy endpoint at 2 years of treatment was the level of improvement from baseline in the international prostate symptom score (IPSS).\nAfter 2 years of treatment, combination therapy showed a statistically significant adjusted mean improvement in symptom scores from baseline of -6.2 units. The adjusted mean improvements in symptom scores observed with the individual therapies were -4.9 units for Avodart and -4.3 units for tamsulosin. The adjusted mean improvement in flow rate from baseline was 2.4 mL/sec for the combination, 1.9 mL/sec for Avodart and 0.9 mL/sec for tamsulosin. The adjusted mean improvement in Blood PressureH Impact Index (BII) from baseline was -2.1 units for the combination, -1.7 for Avodart and -1.5 for tamsulosin.\nThe reduction in total prostate volume and transition zone volume after 2 years of treatment was statistically significant for combination therapy compared to tamsulosin monotherapy alone.\nThe primary efficacy endpoint at 4 years of treatment was time to first event of AUR or Blood PressureH-related surgery. After 4 years of treatment, combination therapy statistically significantly reduced the risk of AUR or Blood PressureH-related surgery (65.8% reduction in risk p<0.001 [95% CI 54.7% to 74.1%]) compared to tamsulosin monotherapy. The incidence of AUR or Blood PressureH-related surgery by Year 4 was 4.2% for combination therapy and 11.9% for tamsulosin (p<0.001). Compared to Avodart monotherapy, combination therapy reduced the risk of AUR or Blood PressureH-related surgery by 19.6%; the difference between treatment groups was not significant (p=0.18 [95% CI -10.9% to 41.7%]). The incidence of AUR or Blood PressureH-related surgery by Year 4 was 4.2% for combination therapy and 5.2% for Avodart.\nClinical progression was defined as a composite of worsening symptoms, (IPSS), and Blood PressureH-related events of AUR, incontinence, UTI, and renal insufficiency. Combination therapy was associated with a statistically significantly lower rate of clinical progression compared with tamsulosin (p<0.001, 44.1% risk reduction [95 % CI: 33.6% to 53.0%]) after 4 years. The rates of clinical progression for combination therapy, tamsulosin, and Avodart were: 12.6%, 21.5%, and 17.8%, respectively.\nThe statistically significant adjusted mean improvement in symptom scores (IPSS) from baseline was maintained from year 2 to year 4. At 4 years, the adjusted mean improvements in symptom scores observed were -6.3 units for combination therapy, -5.3 units for Avodart monotherapy and -3.8 units for tamsulosin monotherapy. After 4 years of treatment, the adjusted mean improvement in flow rate (Qmax) from baseline was 2.4 mL/sec for combination therapy, 2 mL/sec for Avodart monotherapy and 0.7 mL/sec for tamsulosin monotherapy. Compared with tamsulosin, the adjusted mean improvement from baseline in Qmax was statistically significantly greater with combination therapy at each 6-month assessment from Month 6 to Month 48 (p<0.001). Compared with Avodart, the adjusted mean improvement from baseline in Qmax was not statistically significantly different than with combination therapy (p=0.05 at Month 48).\nCombination therapy was significantly superior (p<0.001) to tamsulosin monotherapy and to Avodart monotherapy for the improvement in health outcome parameters BII and Blood PressureH-related Health Status (BHS) at 4 years. The adjusted mean improvement in BII from baseline was -2.2 units for the combination, -1.8 for Avodart and -1.2 for tamsulosin. The adjusted mean improvement in BHS from baseline was -1.5 units for the combination, -1.3 for Avodart and -1.1 for tamsulosin.\nThe reduction in total prostate volume and transition zone volume after 4 years of treatment was statistically significant for combination therapy compared to tamsulosin monotherapy alone.\nIn a 4-year comparison of Avodart co-administered with tamsulosin and dutasteride or tamsulosin monotherapy in men with Blood PressureH (the CombAT study), the incidence of the composite term cardiac failure in the combination group (14/1610, 0.9%) was higher than in either monotherapy group: Avodart, 4/1623 (0.2%) and tamsulosin, 10/1611, (0.6%). The relative risk estimate for time to 1st cardiac failure event was 3.57 [95% CI 1.17, 10.8] for combination treatment compared to Avodart monotherapy and 1.36 [95% CI 0.61, 3.07] compared to tamsulosin monotherapy. No causal relationship between Avodart (alone or in combination with an alpha blocker) and cardiac failure has been established (see Precautions).\nIncidence Of Breast Cancer: In Blood PressureH monotherapy clinical trials, providing 3374 patient years of exposure to Avodart, there were 2 cases of breast cancer reported in Avodart-treated patients, one after 10 weeks and one after 11 months of treatment and 1 case in a patient who received placebo. The relationship between long-term use of dutasteride and male breast cancer is unknown.\nPharmacokinetics: Absorption: Dutasteride is administered orally in solution as a soft gelatin capsule. Following administration of a single 0.5-mg dose, peak serum concentrations of dutasteride occur within 1-3 hrs.\nAbsolute bioavailability in man is approximately 60% relative to a 2-hr IV infusion. The bioavailability of dutasteride is not affected by food.\nDistribution: Pharmacokinetic data following single and repeated oral doses show that dutasteride has a large volume of distribution (300-500 L). Dutasteride is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99.5%).\nFollowing daily dosing, dutasteride serum concentrations achieve 65% of steady-state concentration after 1 month and approximately 90% after 3 months. Steady-state serum concentrations (Css) of approximately 40 ng/mL are achieved after 6 months of dosing 0.5 mg once a day. Similar to serum, dutasteride concentrations in semen achieved steady-state at 6 months. After 52 weeks of therapy, semen dutasteride concentrations averaged 3.4 ng/mL (range 0.4-14 ng/mL). Dutasteride partitioning from serum into semen averaged 11.5%.\nBiotransformation: In vitro, dutasteride is metabolized by the human cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 to 2 minor monohydroxylated metabolites, but it is not metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP2D6.\nIn human serum following dosing to steady-state, unchanged dutasteride, 3 major metabolites (4'-hydroxydutasteride, 1,2-dihydrodutasteride and 6-hydroxydutasteride) and 2 minor metabolites (6,4'-dihydroxydutasteride and 15-hydroxydutasteride), as assessed by mass spectrometric response, have been detected. The 5 human serum metabolites of dutasteride have been detected in rat serum, however, the stereochemistry of the hydroxyl additions at the 6 and 15 positions in the human and rat metabolites is not known.\nElimination: Dutasteride is extensively metabolized. Following oral dosing of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day to steady-state in humans, 1-15.4% (mean of 5.4%) of the administered dose is excreted as dutasteride in the feces. The remainder is excreted in the feces as 4 major metabolites comprising 39%, 21%, 7% and 7% each of drug-related material and 6 minor metabolites (<5% each).\nOnly trace amounts of unchanged dutasteride (<0.1% of the dose) are detected in human urine.\nAt therapeutic concentrations, the terminal t½ of dutasteride is 3-5 weeks.\nSerum concentrations remain detectable (>0.1 ng/mL) for up to 4-6 months after discontinuation of treatment.\nLinearity/Nonlinearity: Dutasteride pharmacokinetics can be described as first order absorption process and 2 parallel elimination pathways, 1 saturable (concentration-dependent) and 1 non-saturable (concentration-independent).\nAt low serum concentrations (<3 ng/mL), dutasteride is cleared rapidly by both the concentration-dependent and concentration-independent elimination pathways. Single doses of =5 mg showed evidence of rapid clearance and a short t½ of 3-9 days.\nAt serum concentrations >3 ng/mL, dutasteride is cleared slowly (0.35-0.58 L/hr) primarily by linear, non-saturable elimination with terminal t½ of 3-5 weeks. At therapeutic concentrations, following repeated dosing of 0.5 mg/day, the slower clearance dominates and the total clearance is linear and concentration-independent.\nElderly: Dutasteride pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were evaluated in 36 healthy male subjects between ages of 24 and 87 years following administration of a single 5-mg dose of dutasteride. Exposure of dutasteride, represented by AUC and Cmax values, was not statistically different when comparing age groups. Half-life was not statistically different when comparing the 50-69 year old group to the >70 year old group, which encompasses the age of most men with Blood PressureH. No differences in drug effect as measured by DHT reduction were observed between age groups.\nResults indicated that no dutasteride dose-adjustment based on age is necessary.\nRenal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on dutasteride pharmacokinetics has not been studied. However, <0.1% of a steady-state 0.5-mg dose of dutasteride is recovered in human urine, so no adjustment in dosage is anticipated for patients with renal impairment.\nHepatic Impairment: The effect on the pharmacokinetics of dutasteride in hepatic impairment has not been studied. (See Precautions.).\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: At exposures greatly in excess of those at the clinical dose, reversible and nonspecific CNS-related effects were seen in rats (425-fold) and dogs (315-fold)\nOther toxicity findings were consistent with the pharmacological activity of 5a-reductase inhibition. In male rats and dogs, these include effects on accessory reproductive organs and, in male rats, a reversible decrease in fertility. This is considered to have no clinical relevance as there was no effect on sperm development, concentration or motility. Feminization of the external genitalia was noted in male fetuses of female rats and rabbits orally dosed with dutasteride. However, IV administration of dutasteride to pregnant Rhesus monkeys during embryofetal development at doses of up to 2010 ng/animal/day did not produce adverse maternal or fetal toxicity. This dose represents a multiple of at least 186-fold (ng/kg basis) the potential maximum daily dose in a 50-kg woman, resulting from exposure to 5 mL semen (assuming 100% absorption) from a dutasteride-treated man.\nDutasteride was not genotoxic in a wide range of mutagenicity tests.\nIn a carcinogenicity study in rats, there was an increase in benign interstitial cell tumours in the testis at the high dose (158-fold clinical exposure). However, the endocrine mechanisms believed to be involved in the production of interstitial cell hyperplasia and adenomas in the rat are not relevant to humans. There were no clinically relevant effects on tumour profile in a carcinogenicity study in mice.",

Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding; markedly impaired liver function; past jaundice with oral contraceptives; undiagnosed ovarian/uterine masses; pelvic infection; neoplasia of primary or secondary sexual organs; hypertension world health organization (WHO) II or worse; renal or cardiac edema; porphyria (Azol can induce ALA synthetase activity and hence porphyrin metabolism).\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: Anabolic steroids and other substances with androgenic effects may have a virilising effect on the female fetus and should be avoided during pregnancy.\nPregnancy should be excluded before commencing therapy and treatment should be commenced during menstruation. A nonhormonal method of contraception should be recommended. If a patient becomes pregnant during treatment, administration of Azol should be discontinued and the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to the fetus. If a patient has become pregnant during treatment, cease taking Azol and consult the physician. Exposure to Azol in utero may result in androgenic effects on the female fetus; reports to date comprise clitoral hypertrophy, labial fusion, urogenital sinus defect, vaginal atresia and ambiguous genitalia.\nIt is known if Azol is excreted in breast milk or whether it has a harmful effect on the newborn. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in nursing mothers.\nWarnings Thromboembolism, thrombotic and thrombophlebitic events including sagittal sinus thrombosis and life-threatening or fatal strokes have been reported.\nExperience with long-term Azol therapy is limited. Serious toxicity (including cholestatic jaundice) has been reported. Peliosis hepatitis and benign hepatic adenoma have been observed with long-term use. Peliosis hepatitis and hepatic adenoma may be silent until complicated by acute, potentially life-threatening intra-abdominal haemorrhage. The physician therefore should be alert to this possibility. In patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE), attempts should be made to determine the lowest dose that will provide adequate protection. If the drug was begun at a time of exacerbation of hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to trauma, stress or other cause, periodic attempts to decrease or withdraw therapy should be considered.\nAzol has been associated with several cases of benign intracranial hypertension, also known as pseudotumour cerebri. Early signs and symptoms of benign intracranial hypertension include papilloedema, headache, nausea and vomiting and visual disturbances.\nPatients with these symptoms should be screened for papilloedema and if present, should be advised to discontinue Azol immediately and be referred to a neurologist for further diagnosis and care.\nA treatment related alteration of lipoproteins in the form of decreased high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and possibly increased low-density lipoproteins (LDL) has been reported during Azol therapy. These alterations may be marked and hence the potential impact on the risk of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease in accordance with the potential benefit of the therapy to the patient should be considered. Clinical evidence suggests that on cessation of Azol therapy, plasma lipoprotein levels return to pre-treatment levels.\nPatients taking Azol may show decreased glucose tolerance. The significance of this aberration for diabetic patients taking Azol is not known, but such patients should be carefully monitored.\nPatients should be watched closely for signs of androgenic effects, some of which may not be reversible, even when administration of Azol is stopped. Therapy with steroids alkylated at the 17 position has been associated with serious toxicity (cholestatic, peliosis hepatitis and hepatic adenomas). The physician should be alert to the possibility that such toxicity may develop with Azol.\nBefore initiating therapy of fibrocystic breast disease with Azol, carcinoma of breast should be excluded. However, nodularity, pain, tenderness due to fibrocystic, breast disease may prevent recognition of underlying carcinoma before treatment is begun. Therefore, if any nodule persist or enlarges during treatment, carcinoma should be considered and ruled out.",
      "special-precautions": "Fluid retention may be produced to such a degree as to necessitate the use of diuretics. However, in some cases, fluid retention may be controlled by restriction of salt intake. Patients with conditions which may be influenced by fluid retention eg, epilepsy, migraine or cardiac or renal dysfunction, require careful observation.\nAndrogenic/anabolic effects may be seen in female patients eg, acne, oily skin, decreased breast size, vaginitis, clitoral hypertrophy, hot flushes, hirsutism, deepening of the voice and weight gain (up to 6.5 kg). Patients should be advised to report signs eg, voice changes or hirsutism promptly, as these effects may persist even when drug administration has been stopped. Testicular atrophy may occur rarely in male patients. Semen quantity and quality should be checked regularly, especially in adolescents.\nSince hepatic dysfunction manifested by modest increases in serum transaminase levels and/or jaundice has been reported in patients treated with Azol, periodic liver function tests should be performed (see Warnings). Administration of Azol has been reported to cause exacerbation of the manifestations of acute intermittent porphyria (see Contraindications).\nUse in pregnancy: In female patients, ovulation and menses may cease. Use of Azol during pregnancy may damage the fetus and that if pregnancy is suspected, it should be stopped and a physician consulted. A nonhormonal method of contraception should be recommended. Therapy should begin during menstruation.\nUse in children: Safety and efficacy in children has not been established.\nSide Effects In general, the side effects associated with Azol therapy are attributable to the pharmacological activity of the drug; these effects reflect Azol's weak androgenic and anabolic activity, and/or the gonadal suppression which results from therapy. Incidence rates are indicated for more common reactions.\nAndrogenic/Anabolic Effects: Weight gain (4%), acne (13%), seborrhoea (2%), mild hirsutism (5%), edema (6%) and hair loss. Voice change (3%), which may take the form of hoarseness, sore throat or of instability or deepening of the pitch, may occur and may persist after cessation of therapy. Hypertrophy of the clitoris is rare.\nEndocrine: Menstrual disturbances in the form of spotting, alteration of the timing of the cycle and amenorrhoea. Although cyclical bleeding and ovulation usually return within 60-90 days after discontinuation of Azol, persistent amenorrhoea has occasionally been reported. Flushing (6%), sweating (3%), vaginal dryness and irritation (4%) and changes in breast size, may reflect lowering of oestrogen. Nervousness and emotional lability have been reported. Abnormalities in semen volume, viscosity, sperm count and motility may occur in males receiving long-term therapy. Testicular atrophy may occur rarely.\nHepatic Impairment: Hepatic dysfunction, as evidenced by elevated serum enzymes and/or jaundice, has been reported in patients receiving a daily dosage of Azol >400 mg. Serious hepatic toxicity including cholestatic jaundice, peliosis hepatitis and hepatic adenoma have been reported (see Warnings and Precautions).\nBiochemical: Alteration in values of laboratory tests may occur during Azol therapy, including: Creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), glucose tolerance, glucagon, thyroid binding globulin, sex hormone binding globulin, other plasma proteins, raised aspartate transaminase (AST), decreased protein bind iodine (PBI), depressed serum T4, blunted cyclical surges of luteinizing hormone (LH), raised total cholesterol, reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (see Warnings).\nThe following reactions have also been reported: Allergic: Urticaria, pruritus and rarely, nasal congestion.\nDermatological: Rashes (3%) (maculopapular, vesicular, papular, purpuric, petechial) and rarely sun sensitivity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\nGastrointestinal: Nausea (2%), vomiting, constipation, indigestion, gastroenteritis and rarely pancreatitis.\nGenitourinary: Haematuria.\nMusculoskeletal: Muscle cramps or spasms or pains, arthralgia, joint lock-up, joint-swelling, pain in back, neck or extremities and rarely, carpal tunnel syndrome which may be secondary to fluid retention.\nCentral Nervous System: Headache, weakness, faintness, irritability, dizziness, depression fatigue, paraesthesias, visual disturbances, sleep disorders, tremor and rarely, benign intracranial hypertension, anxiety, changes in appetite, chills and, rarely, Guillain-Barré syndrome.\nHaematological: Increased red cell and platelet count. Reversible erythrocytosis, leucocytosis or polycythemia may be provoked. Eosinophilia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia also have been noted. Thrombotic events, including sagittal sinus thrombosis and cerebrovascular accident (CVA), backache have also been reported infrequently.\nOther: Increased insulin requirements in diabetic patients, changes in libido, elevation in blood pressure and rarely, nipple discharge, cataracts, bleeding gums, fever, pelvic pain, Bartholin's cyst.",
      "adverse-reactions": "Acne, oily skin, deepening of voice, hot flushes, mild hirsutism, decrease in breast size, wt gain, clitoral hypertrophy (rarely); hepatic dysfunction, alteration in value of lab test, allergic, dermatologic, GI, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, CNS, hematological. ",
      "interactions": "Warfarin: Prolongation of prothrombin time occurs in patients stabilized on warfarin.\nCarbamazepine: Therapy with Azol may reduce the plasma clearance of carbamazepine, increasing its elimination half-life and plasma concentration.\nCyclosporin: Therapy with Azol may cause an increase in the serum levels of concomitantly administered cyclosporin.\nOral Contraceptives: Although no specific interaction has been recorded, it is recommended that oral contraceptives should not be used concurrently with Azol.\nLaboratory Tests: Azol treatment may interfere with laboratory determinations of testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone.",
      "pregnancy-safe": "Category X: Studies in animals or human beings have demonstrated foetal abnormalities or there is evidence of foetal risk based on human experience or both, and the risk of the use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweighs any possible benefit.

      "storage": "Store at temperature below 25°C.",
      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Mode of Action: Endometriosis and Menorrhagia: In woman of reproductive age, Azol suppresses the pituitary ovarian axis. This suppression is probably a combination of depressed hypothalamic-pituitary response to lowered estrogen production, the alteration of sex steroid metabolism and the interaction of Azol with sex hormone receptors.\nThe only other demonstrable hormonal effect is weak androgenic activity and associated anabolic activity. No significant estrogenic or progestational activity attributable to Azol has been found.\nAzol depressed the output of both follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).\nIn the treatment of endometriosis, Azol alters the normal and ectopic endometrial tissue so that it becomes inactive and atrophic. Complete resolution of endometrial lesions occurs in the majority of cases.\nChange in vaginal cytology and cervical mucus reflect the suppressive effect of Azol on the pituitary-ovarian axis.\nThe mechanism of action of Azol in the suppression of menstrual blood loss is not clear. However, Azol inhibits ovulation and plasma levels of oestradiol-17b fall. Whether endometrial proliferation is inhibited by reduced oestradiol levels or by a direct effect of Azol on endometrial oestrogen receptors is not known.\nGenerally, the pituitary suppressive action of Azol is reversible. When Azol treatment is discontinued, ovulation usually resumes within a few weeks as demonstrated by the major surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) and minor follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) surge that accompany ovulation.\nFibrocystic Breast Disease: Azol suppresses the ovulatory luteinizing surge, interferes with gonadal steroidogenesis (directly and indirectly) and dampens the gonadotrophin response to luteinizing hormone.\nClinical Experience: Endometriosis and Menorrhagia: Clinically, the action of Azol has been demonstrated by human pharmacological studies and clinical trials. At a sufficiently high daily dose, Azol therapy results in inhibition of ovulation, suppression of menses, regressive changes of the vaginal mucosa and marked atrophy of the endometrium.\nVaginal spotting or bleeding may occur in some patients during therapy with Azol; in cases where it has been examined, this bleeding was associated with an atrophic endometrium.\nAzol therapy has been successful in the treatment of endometriosis, relief of the common presenting symptoms of dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain and dyspareunia, resolution of ectopic endometrial implants and induration of the cul-de-sac has been obtained. Significant reversal of infertility associated with endometriosis has followed a course of Azol therapy.\nClinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of Azol in the short-term management of menorrhagia. The reduction in blood loss continued for up to 3 months after stopping treatment. Other benefits have been relief of dysmenorrhoea, failure to influence menstrual cycle length, reduction in the number of days bleeding and a steady improvement in haemoglobin values despite the absence of iron therapy.\nFibrocystic Breast Disease: Both placebo-controlled and open studies with Azol in treating severe fibrocystic breast disease or mastalgia associated with severe breast disease have shown Azol to produce partial to complete disappearance of nodularity and complete relief of pain and tenderness. Limited studies suggest Azol to be effective in reducing breast cyst formation. Changes in the menstrual pattern may occur.",

      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: Mupirocin is a novel antibiotic produced through fermentation by Pseudomonas fluorescens. Mupirocin inhibits isoleucyl transfer-RNA synthetase, thereby arresting bacterial protein synthesis. Due to this particular mode of action and its unique chemical structure, mupirocin does not show any cross-resistance with other clinically available antibiotics. Mupirocin shows little risk of selection of bacterial resistance if used as prescribed. Mupirocin has bacteriostatic properties at minimum inhibitory concentrations and bactericidal properties at the higher concentrations reached when applied locally.\nPharmacokinetics: Systemic absorption of mupirocin through intact human skin is low although it may occur through broken/diseased skin. However, clinical trials have shown that when given systemically, it is metabolised to the microbiologically inactive metabolite monic acid and rapidly excreted. Mupirocin is rapidly eliminated from the body by metabolism to its inactive metabolite monic acid, which is rapidly excreted by the kidney.\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: No further information of relevance.\nMicrobiology: Mupirocin is a topical antibacterial agent showing in vivo activity against Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), S. epidermidis and ß-hemolytic Streptococcus species.\nThe in vitro spectrum of activity includes the following bacteria: Aerobic Gram-Positive: Staphylococcus aureus (including ß-lactamase-producing and methicillin-resistant strains); Staphylococcus epidermidis (including ß-lactamase-producing and methicillin-resistant strains); other coagulase-negative Staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains); Streptococcus species.\nAerobic Gram-Negative: Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Moraxella catarrhalis and Pasteurella multocida.",

Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogues to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors. Lactic Acidosis with Baraclude should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).\nSevere Acute Exacerbations of Hepatitis B: Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including entecavir. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.\nPatients Co-Infected with HIV and HBV: Baraclude has not been evaluated in HIV/HBV co-infected patients who were not simultaneously receiving effective HIV treatment. Limited clinical experience suggests there is a potential for the development of resistance to HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors if Baraclude is used to treat chronic HBV infection in patients with HIV infection that is not being treated (see Pharmacology under Actions). Therefore, therapy with Baraclude is not recommended for HIV/HBV co-infected patients who are not also receiving HAART. Before initiating Baraclude therapy, HIV antibody testing should be offered to all patients. Baraclude has not been studied as a treatment for HIV infection and is not recommended for this use.",
      "special-precautions": "General: Renal Impairment: Dosage adjustment of Baraclude is recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance <50 mL/min, including patients on hemodialysis or CAPD (see Renal Impairment under Dosage and Administration).\nPost-Liver Transplant Recipients: The safety and efficacy of Baraclude in liver transplant recipients are unknown. However, in a small pilot study of entecavir use in HBV-infected liver transplant recipients on a stable dose of cyclosporine A (n=5) or tacrolimus (n=4), entecavir exposure was approximately 2-fold healthy subjects with normal renal function. Altered renal function contributed to the increased in entecavir exposure in these subject. The potential of pharmacokinetic interactions between entecavir and cyclosporine A or tacrolimus was not formally evaluated. Renal function must be carefully monitored both before and during treatment with Baraclude in liver transplant recipients who have received or are receiving an immunosupresant that may affect renal function eg, cyclosporine or tacrolimus. (See Pharmacokinetics: Special Population under Action, and Renal Impairment under Dosage and Administration).\nInformation for Patients: Patients should remain under the care of a physician while taking Baraclude. The patient should discuss any new symptoms or concurrent medications with their physician.\nLamivudine-refractory patients receiving the 1-mg daily dose should be advised to take Baraclude on an empty stomach (at least 2 hrs after a meal and 2 hrs before the next meal).\nPatients should be informed that deterioration of liver disease may occur in some cases if treatment is discontinued, and that the patient should discuss any change in regimen with the physician.\nPatient should be offered HIV antibody testing before starting Baraclude therapy. The patient should be informed that if the patient have HIV infection and are not receiving effective HIV treatment, Baraclude may increase the chance of HIV resistance to HIV medication (see Patient Co-Infected with HIV and HBV under Warnings).\nPatients should be advised that treatment with Baraclude has not been shown to reduce the risk of transmission of HBV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination (see Labor and Delivery).\nCarcinogenicity, Mutagenicity and Impairment of Fertility: Long-term oral carcinogenicity studies of entecavir in mice and rats were carried out at exposures up to approximately 42 times (mice) and 35 times (rats) those observed in humans at the highest recommended dose of 1 mg/day. In mouse and rat studies, entecavir was positive for carcinogenic findings.\nIn mice, lung adenomas were increased in males and females at exposures 3 times and 40 times those in humans. Lung carcinomas in both male and female mice were increased at exposures 40 times those in humans. Combined lung adenomas and carcinomas were increased in male mice at exposures 3 times and in female mice at exposures 40 times those in humans. Tumor development was preceded by pneumocyte proliferation in the lung, which was not observed in rats, dogs, or monkeys administered entecavir, supporting the conclusion that lung tumors in mice may be a species-specific event. Hepatocellular carcinomas were increased in males and combined liver adenomas and carcinomas were also increased at exposures 42 times those in humans. Vascular tumors in female mice (hemangiomas of ovaries and uterus and hemangiosarcomas of spleen) were increased at exposures 40 times those in humans. In rats, hepatocellular adenomas were increased in females at exposures 24 times those in humans; combined adenomas and carcinomas were also increased in females at exposures 24 times those in humans. Brain gliomas were induced in both males and females at exposures 35 and 24 times those in humans. Skin fibromas were induced in females at exposures 4 times those in humans.\nIt is not known how predictive the results of rodent carcinogenicity studies may be for humans.\nEntecavir was clastogenic to human lymphocyte cultures. Entecavir was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay using S. typhimurium and E. coli strains in the presence or absence of metabolic activation, a mammalian-cell gene mutation assay, and a transformation assay with Syrian hamster embryo cells. Entecavir was also negative in an oral micronucleus study and an oral DNA repair study in rats. In reproductive toxicology studies, in which animals were administered entecavir at up to 30 mg/kg for up to 4 weeks, no evidence of impaired fertility was seen in male or female rats at systemic exposures >90 times those achieved in humans at the highest recommended dose of 1 mg/day. In rodent and dog toxicology studies, seminiferous tubular degeneration was observed at exposures =35 times those achieved in humans. No testicular changes were evident in monkeys.\nUse in pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at orally administered doses up to 200 mg/kg/day and 16 mg/kg/day and showed no embryotoxicity or maternal toxicity at systemic exposures approximately 28 times and 212 times those achieved at the highest recommended dose of 1 mg/day in humans. In rats, maternal toxicity, embryo-fetal toxicity (resorptions), lower fetal body weights, tail and vertebral malformations, reduced ossification (vertebrae, sternebrae, and phalanges), and extra lumbar vertebrae and ribs were observed at exposures 3100 times those in humans. In rabbits, embryo-fetal toxicity (resorptions), reduced ossification (hyoid), and an increased incidence of 13th rib were observed at exposures 883 times those in humans. In a peri-postnatal study, no adverse effects on offspring were seen with entecavir administered orally to rats at exposures >94 times those in humans. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Baraclude should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed and after careful consideration of the risks and benefits.\nLabor and Delivery: There are no studies in pregnant women and no data on the effect of Baraclude on transmission of HBV from mother to infant. Therefore, appropriate interventions should be used to prevent neonatal acquisition of HBV.\nUse in lactation: Entecavir is excreted in the milk of rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Mothers should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are taking Baraclude.\nUse in children: Safety and effectiveness of entecavir in pediatric patients <16 years have not been established.\nUse in the elderly: Clinical studies of Baraclude did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Entecavir is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see Renal Impairment under Dosage and Administration).\nUse in Racial/Ethnic Groups: Clinical studies of Baraclude did not include sufficient numbers of subjects from some racial/ethnic minorities (Black/African American, Hispanic) to determine whether they respond differently to treatment with the drug. There are no significant racial differences in entecavir pharmacokinetics.",
      "adverse-reactions": "Clinical Trial Experience: Because clinical trial are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nCompensated Liver Disease: Assessment of adverse reactions is based on 4 studies (AI463014, AI463022, AI463026, and AI463027) in which 1720 subjects with chronic hepatitis B infection and compensated liver disease received double-blind treatment with Baraclude 0.5 mg/day (n=679), Baraclude 1 mg/day (n=183) or lamivudine (n=858) for up to 2 years. Median duration of therapy was 69 weeks for Baraclude-treated subjects and 63 weeks for lamivudine-treated subjects in studies AI463022 and AI463027 and 73 weeks for Baraclude-treated subjects and 51 weeks for lamivudine-treated subjects in studies AI463026 and AI463014. The safety profiles of Baraclude and lamivudine were comparable in these studies. The safety profile of Baraclude 1 mg (n=51) in HIV/HBV co-infected subjects enrolled in study AI463038 was similar to that of placebo (n=17) through 24 weeks of blinded treatment and similar to that seen in non-HIV infected patients.\nThe most common adverse events of any severity with at least a possible relation to study drug for Baraclude-treated subjects were headache, fatigue, dizziness and nausea. The most common adverse events among lamivudine-treated subjects were headache, fatigue and dizziness. One percent of Baraclude-treated subjects in these 4 studies compared with 4% of lamivudine-treated subjects discontinued for adverse events or abnormal laboratory test results (see Warnings and Precautions).\nClinical Adverse Events: Selected clinical adverse events of moderate to severe intensity and considered at least possibly related to treatment occurring during therapy in 4 clinical studies in which Baraclude was compared with lamivudine are presented in Table 11. (See Table 11.)\nLaboratory Abnormalities: Frequencies of selected treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities reported during therapy in 4 clinical trials of Baraclude compared with lamivudine are listed in Table 12. (See Table 12.)\nAmong Baraclude-treated subjects in these studies, on-treatment ALT elevations >10 x ULN and >2 x baseline generally resolved with continued treatment. A majority of these exacerbations were associated with a =2 log10/mL reduction in viral load that preceded or coincided with the ALT elevation. Periodic monitoring of hepatic function is recommended during treatment.\nExacerbations of Hepatitis After Discontinuation of Treatment: An exacerbation of hepatitis or ALT flare was defined as ALT >10 x ULN and >2 x the subject's reference level (minimum baseline or last measurement at end of dosing). For all subjects who discontinued the treatment, regardless of reason, Table 12 presents the proportion of subjects in each study who experienced post-treatment ALT flares. In these studies, a subset of subjects was allowed to discontinue treatment at or after 52 weeks if they achieved a protocol-defined response to therapy. If Baraclude is discontinued without regard to treatment response, the rate of post-treatment flares could be higher (see Warnings and Precautions). (See Table 13.)\nDecompensated Liver Disease: Study AI463048 was a randomized, open-label study of Baraclude 1 mg once daily versus adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg once daily given for up to 48 weeks in adult subjects with chronic HBV infection and evidence of hepatic decompensation, defined as a Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score of 7 or higher (see Microbiology: Clinical Studies under Actions). Among the 102 subjects receiving Baraclude, the most common treatment emergent adverse events of any severity, regardless of causality, occurring through week 48 were peripheral edema (16%), ascites (15%), pyrexia (14%), hepatic encephalophathy (10%), and upper respiratory infection (10%). Clinical adverse reactions not listed in Table 11 that were observed through week 48 include blood bicarbonate decreased (2%) and renal failure (<1%). Eighteen of 102 (18%) subjects treated with Baraclude and 18/89 (20%) subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil died during the first 48 weeks of therapy. The majority of deaths (11 in the Baraclude group and 16 in the adefovir dipivoxil group) were due to liver-related causes eg, hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through week 48 was 6% (6/102) for subjects treated with Baraclude and 8% (7/89) for subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil. Five percent (5%) of subjects in either treatment arm discontinued therapy due to an adverse event through week 48. No subject in either treatment arm experienced an on-treatment hepatic flare (ALT >2 x baseline and >10 x ULN) through week 48. Eleven of 102 (11%) subjects treated with Baraclude and 11/89 (13%) subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil had a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL through week 48. No subject in either treatment arm experienced an on-treatment hepatic flare (ALT >2 x baseline and >10 x ULN) through week 48. Eleven of 102 (11%) subjects treated with Baraclude and 11/89 (13%) subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil had a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL through week 48.\nPost-Marketing Experience: The following adverse reaction has been reported during post-marketing use of Baraclude. Because these reaction were reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to Baraclude exposure.\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Rash, alopecia.\nImmune System Disorders: Anaphylactoid reaction.\nMetabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Lactic acidosis has been reported, often in association with hepatic decompensation, other serious medical conditions, or drug exposures. Patients with decompensated liver disease may be at higher risk for lactic acidosis.\nHepatobiliary Disorders: Increased transaminases.\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Alopecia, rash.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "Since entecavir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys (see Pharmacology: Pharmacokinetics: Metabolism and Elimination under Actions), co-administration of Baraclude with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of either entecavir or the co-administered drug.

Film-Coating: Titanium dioxide, hypromellose, polyethylene glycol 400, polysorbate 80 (0.5-mg tablet only) and red iron oxide (1-mg tablet only).\nEntecavir is a guanosine nucleoside analogue with selective activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). Entecavir is 2-amino-1,9-dihydro-9-[(1S,3R,4S)-4-hydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylenecyclopentyl]-6H-purin-6-one, monohydrate. Its molecular formula is C12H15N5O3·H2O, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 295.3. It is slightly soluble in water (2.4 mg/mL), and the pH of the saturated solution in water is 7.9 at 25°±0.5°C.",
      "mechanism": "Microbiology: Mechanism of Action: Entecavir, a guanosine nucleoside analogue with activity against HBV polymerase, is efficiently phosphorylated to the active triphosphate form, which has an intracellular half-life of 15 hrs. By competing with the natural substrate deoxyguanosine triphosphate, entecavir triphosphate functionally inhibits all three activities of the HBV polymerase [reverse transcriptase (RT)]: 1) Base priming. 2) Reverse transcription of the negative strand from the pregenomic messenger RNA. 3) Synthesis of the positive strand of HBV DNA. Entecavir triphosphate is a weak inhibitor of cellular DNA polymerases a, ß and d and mitochondrial DNA polymerase ? with Ki values ranging from 18 to >160 mcM.\nAntiviral Activity: Entecavir inhibited HBV DNA synthesis [50% reduction, maximum effective concentration (EC50)] at a concentration of 0.004 mcM in human HepG2 cells transfected with wild-type HBV. The median EC50 value for entecavir against lamivudine-resistant HBV (rtL180M, rtM204V) was 0.026 mcM (range 0.01-0.059 mcM).\nThe co-administration of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) with Baraclude is unlikely to reduce the antiviral efficacy of Baraclude against HBV or of any of these agents against HIV. In HBV combination assays in cell culture, abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir or zidovudine were not antagonistic to the anti-HBV activity of entecavir over a wide range of concentrations. In HIV antiviral assays, entecavir was not antagonistic to the cell culture anti-HIV activity of these 6 NRTIs at >4 times the peak plasma drug concentration (Cmax) of entecavir.\nAntiviral Activity Against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV): A comprehensive analysis of the inhibitory activity of entecavir against a panel of laboratory and clinical human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates using a variety of cells and assay conditions yielded EC50 values ranging from 0.026 to >10 mcM; lower EC50 values were observed when decreased levels of virus were used in the assay. In cell culture, entecavir selected for an M184l substitution in HIV reverse transcriptase at micromolar concentrations, confirming inhibitory pressure at high entecavir concentrations. HIV variants containing the M184V substitution showed loss of susceptibility to entecavir.\nResistance: In Cell Culture: In cell-based assays, 8- to 30-fold reductions in entecavir phenotypic susceptibility were observed for lamivudine-resistant strains. Further reductions (>70-fold) in entecavir phenotypic susceptibility required the presence of amino acid substitutions rtM204I/V and/or rtL180M along with additional substitutions at residues rtT184, rtS202 or rtM250, or a combination of these substitutions with or without an rtI169 substitution in the HBV polymerase.\nClinical Studies: All patients in clinical trials initially treated with entecavir 0.5 mg (nucleoside-naive, studies AI463022, AI463027 and rollover study AI463901) or 1 mg (lamivudine-refractory, studies AI463026, AI463014, AI463015 and rollover study AI463901) and with an on-therapy PCR HBV DNA measurement at or after week-24 were monitored for resistance.\nNucleoside-Naive Subjects: Genotypic evidence of entecavir resistance-associated (ETVr) substitutions at rtT184, rtS202 and/or rtM250 were identified in <1% of patients treated with entecavir for up to 144 weeks in nucleoside-naive studies (Table 1). These substitutions were observed only in the presence of lamivudine resistance-associated (LVDr) substitutions (rtM204V and rtL180M) (see Table 1).\nLamivudine-Refractory Subjects: ETVr substitutions were observed at baseline in isolates from 10/187 (5%) lamivudine-refractory patients treated with entecavir and monitored for resistance, indicating that prior lamivudine treatment can select these resistance substitutions and that they can exist at a low frequency before entecavir treatment. Through week 144, 3 of the 10 patients experienced virologic rebound (=1 log10 increase above nadir). Emerging entecavir resistance in lamivudine-refractory studies through week 144 is summarized in Table 2. (See Table 2.)\nCross-Resistance: Cross-resistance has been observed among HBV nucleoside analogues. In cell-based assays, entecavir had 8- to 30-fold less inhibition of HBV DNA synthesis for HBV containing lamivudine and telbivudine resistance substitutions rtM204I/V ± rtL180M than for wild-type HBV. Substitutions rtM204I/V ± rtL180M, rtL80I/V or rtV173L, which are associated with lamivudine and telbivudine resistance, also confer decreased phenotypic susceptibility to entecavir. Recombinant HBV genomes encoding adefovir resistance-associated substitutions at either rtN236T or rtA181V had 0.3- and 1.1-fold shifts in susceptibility to entecavir in cell culture, respectively. The efficacy of entecavir against HBV harboring adefovir resistance-associated substitutions has not been established in clinical trials. HBV isolates from lamivudine-refractory subjects failing entecavir therapy were susceptible in cell culture to adefovir but remained to lamivudine.\nPharmacology: Pharmacokinetics: The single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of entecavir were evaluated in healthy subjects and patients with chronic hepatitis B infection.\nAbsorption: Following oral administration in healthy subjects, entecavir peak plasma concentrations occurred between 0.5 and 1.5 hrs. Following multiple daily doses ranging from 0.1-1 mg, Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) at steady-state increased in proportion to dose. Steady-state was achieved after 6-10 days of once-daily administration with approximately 2-fold accumulation. For a 0.5-mg oral dose, Cmax at steady-state was 4.2 ng/mL and trough plasma concentration (Ctrough) was 0.3 ng/mL. For a 1-mg oral dose, Cmax was 8.2 ng/mL and Ctrough was 0.5 ng/mL.\nEffects of Food on Oral Absorption: Oral administration of entecavir 0.5 mg with a standard high-fat meal (945 kcal, 54.6 g fat) or a light meal (379 kcal, 8.2 g fat) resulted in a delay in absorption (1-1.5 hrs fed vs 0.75 hr fasted), a decrease in Cmax of 44-46%, and a decrease in AUC of 18-20% (see Dosage and Administration).\nDistribution: Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of entecavir after oral dosing, the estimated apparent volume of distribution is in excess of total body water, suggesting that entecavir is extensively distributed into tissues.\nBinding of entecavir to human serum proteins in vitro was approximately 13%.\nMetabolism and Elimination: Following administration of 14C-entecavir in humans and rats, no oxidative or acetylated metabolites were observed. Minor amounts of phase II metabolites (glucuronide and sulfate conjugates) were observed. Entecavir is not a substrate, inhibitor or inducer of the cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) enzyme system (see Drug Interactions).\nAfter reaching peak concentration, entecavir plasma concentrations decreased in a bi-exponential manner with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 128-149 hrs. The observed drug accumulation index is approximately 2-fold with once-daily dosing, suggesting an effective accumulation half-life of approximately 24 hrs.\nEntecavir is predominantly eliminated by the kidney with urinary recovery of unchanged drug at steady-state ranging from 62-73% of the administered dose. Renal clearance is independent of dose and ranges from 360-471 mL/min suggesting that entecavir undergoes both glomerular filtration and net tubular secretion (see Interactions).\nSpecial Populations: Gender: There are no significant gender differences in entecavir pharmacokinetics.\nRace: There are no significant racial differences in entecavir pharmacokinetics.\nElderly: The effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of entecavir was evaluated following administration of a single 1-mg oral dose in healthy young and elderly volunteers. Entecavir AUC was 29.3% greater in elderly subjects compared to young subjects. The disparity in exposure between elderly and young was most likely attributable to differences in renal function. Dosage adjustment of Baraclude should be based on the renal function of the patient, rather than age (see Renal Impairment under Dosage and Administration).\nPediatrics: Pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted in children.\nRenal Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of entecavir following a single 1-mg dose were studied in subjects (without chronic hepatitis B infection) with selected degrees of renal impairment, including subjects whose renal impairment was managed by hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Results are shown in Table 3. (See Table 3.)\nDosage adjustment is recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance <50 mL/min, including patients on hemodialysis or CAPD. (See Renal Impairment under Dosage and Administration.)\nFollowing a single dose of entecavir 1 mg administered 2 hrs before the hemodialysis session, hemodialysis removed approximately 13% of the entecavir dose over 4 hrs. CAPD removed approximately 0.3% of the dose over 7 days. Entecavir should be administered after hemodialysis.\nHepatic Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of entecavir following a single 1-mg dose were studied in subjects (without chronic hepatitis B infection) with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C). The pharmacokinetics of entecavir were similar between hepatically impaired subjects and healthy control subjects; therefore, no dosage adjustment of Baraclude is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment.\nPost-Liver Transplant: The safety and efficacy of Baraclude in liver transplant recipients are unknown. However, in a small pilot study of entecavir use in HBV-infected liver transplant recipients on a stable dose of cyclosporine A (n=5) or tacrolimus (n=4), entecavir exposure was approximately 2-fold the exposure in healthy subjects with normal renal function. Altered renal function contributed to the increased in entecavir exposure in these subjects. The potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between entecavir and cyclosporine A or tacrolimus was not formally evaluated. Renal function must be carefully monitored both before and during treatment with Baraclude in liver transplant recipients who have received or are receiving an immunosuppressant that may affect renal function eg, cyclosporine or tacrolimus (see Renal Impairment under Dosage and Administration).\nDrug Interactions (see also Interactions): The metabolism of entecavir was evaluated in in vivo studies. Entecavir is not a substrate, inhibitor or inducer of the cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) enzyme system. At concentrations up to approximately 10,000-fold higher than those obtained in humans, entecavir inhibited none of the major human CYP450 enzymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, 2B6, and 2E1. At concentrations up to approximately 340-fold higher than those observed in humans, entecavir did not induce the human CYP450 enzymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, 3A5, and 2B6 (see Metabolism and Elimination in the previous text). The pharmacokinetics of entecavir are unlikely to be affected by co-administration with agents that are either metabolized by, inhibit or induce the CYP450 system. Likewise, the pharmacokinetics of known CYP substrates are unlikely to be affected by co-administration of entecavir.\nThe steady-state pharmacokinetics of entecavir and co-administered drug were not altered in interaction studies of entecavir with lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.\nDescription of Clinical Studies: Outcomes at 48 Weeks: The safety and efficacy of Baraclude were evaluated in 3 phase III active-controlled trials. These studies included 1633 subjects =16 years with chronic hepatitis B infection (serum HBsAg-positive for at least 6 months) accompanied by evidence of viral replication (detectable serum HBV DNA, as measured by the bDNA hybridization or PCR assay). Subjects had persistently elevated ALT levels ~1.3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and chronic inflammation on liver biopsy compatible with a diagnosis of chronic viral hepatitis. The safety and efficacy of Baraclude were also evaluated in a study of 191 HBV-infected subjects with decompensated liver disease and in a study of 68 subjects co-infected with HBV and HIV.\nNucleoside-Naive Subjects With Compensated Liver: HBeAg-Positive: Study AI463022 was a multinational, randomized, double-blind study of Baraclude 0.5 mg once daily versus lamivudine 100 mg once daily for a minimum of 52 weeks in 709 (of 715 randomized) nucleoside-naive subjects with chronic hepatitis B infection and detectable HBeAg. The mean age of subjects was 35 years, 75% male, 57% Asian, 40% Caucasian, and 13% had previously received interferon-a. At baseline, subjects had amean Knodel! Necroinflammatory score of 7.8, mean serum HBV DNA as measured by Roche COBAS Amplicor PCR assay was 9.66 log10 copies/mL, and mean serum ALT level was 143 U/L. Paired, adequate liver biopsy samples were available for 89% of subjects.\nHBeAg-Negative (Anti-HBe Positive/HBV DNA Positive): Study AI463027 was a multinational, randomized, double-blind study of Baraclude 0.5 mg once daily versus lamivudine 100 mg once daily for a minimum of 52 weeks in 638 (of 648 randomized) nucleoside-naive subjects with HBeAg-negative (HBeAb-positive) chronic hepatitis B infection. The mean age of subjects was 44 years, 76% male, 39% Asian, 58% Caucasian, and 13% had previously received interferon-a. At baseline, subjects had a mean Knodell Necroinflammatory Score of 7.8, mean serum HBV DNA as measured by Roche COBAS Amplicor PCR assay was 7.58 log10 copies/mL, and mean serum ALT level was 142 U/L. Paired, adequate liver biopsy samples were available for 88% of subjects.\nIn Studies AI463022 and A1463027, Baraclude was superior to lamivudine on the primary efficacy endpoint of Histologic Improvement, defined as =2-point reduction in Knodell Necroinflammatory Score with no worsening in Knodell Fibrosis Score at week 48, and on the secondary efficacy measures of reduction in viral load and ALT normalization. Histologic improvement and change in Ishak Fibrosis Score are shown in Table 4. Selected virologic, biochemical, and serologic outcome measures are shown in Table 5. (See Tables 4 and 5.)\nHistologic improvement was independent of baseline levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT).\nLamivudine-Refractory Subjects with Compensated Liver Disease: Study AI463026 was a multinational, randomized, double-blind study of Baraclude in 286 (of 293 randomized) subjects with lamivudine-refractory chronic hepatitis B infection. Subjects receiving lamivudine at study entry either switched to Baraclude 1 mg once daily (with neither a washout nor an overlap period) or continued on lamivudine 100 mg for a minimum of 52 weeks. The mean age of subjects was 39 years, 76% male, 37% Asian, 62% Caucasian and 52% had previously received interferon-a. The mean duration of prior lamivudine therapy was 2.7 years, and 85% had lamivudine resistance mutations at baseline by an investigational line probe assay. At baseline, subjects had a mean Knodell Necroinflammatory score of 6.5, mean serum HBV DNA as measured by Roche COBAS Amplicor PCR assay was 9.36 log10 copies/mL, and mean serum ALT level was 128 U/L. Paired, adequate liver biopsy samples were available for 87% of subjects.\nBaraclude was superior to lamivudine on a primary end point of Histologic Improvement (using the. Knodell score at week 48). These results and change in Ishak Fibrosis score are shown in Table 6. Table 7 shows selected virologic, biochemical, and serologic endpoints (see Tables 6 and 7).\nHistologic improvement was independent of baseline levels of HBV DNA or ALT.\nSubjects with Decompensated Liver Disease: Study AI463048 was a randomized, open-label study of Baraclude 1 mg once daily versus adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg once daily in 191 (of 195 randomized) adult subjects with HBeAg-positive or -negative chronic HBV infection and evidence of hepatic decompensation, defined as a Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score of =7. Subjects were either HBV-treatment-naive or previously treated, predominantly with lamivudine or interferon-a. In Study AI463048, 100 subjects were randomized to treatment with Baraclude and 91 subjects to treatment with adefovir dipivoxil. Two (2) subjects randomized to treatment with adefovir dipivoxil actually received treatment with Baraclude for the duration of the study. The mean age of subjects was 52 years, 74% were male, 54% were Asian, 33% were Caucasian and 5% were Black/African American. At baseline, subjects had a mean serum HBV DNA by PCR of 7.83 log10 copies/mL and mean ALT level of 100 U/L; 54% of subjects were HBeAg-positive; 35% had genotypic evidence of lamivudine resistance. The baseline mean CTP score was 8.6. Results for selected study endpoints at week 48 are shown in Table 8. (See Table 8.)\nSubjects Co-Infected with HIV and HBV: Study AI463038 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Baraclude versus placebo in 68 patients co-infected with HIV and HBV who experienced recurrence of HBV viremia while receiving a lamivudine-containing highly active antiretroviral (HAART) regimen. Subjects continued their lamivudine-containing HAART regimen (lamivudine dose 300 mg/day) and were assigned to add either Baraclude 1 mg once daily (51 subjects) or placebo (17 subjects) for 24 weeks followed by an open-label phase for an additional 24 weeks where all subjects received Baraclude. At baseline, subjects had a mean serum HBV DNA level by PCR of 9.13 log10 copies/mL. Ninety-nine percent (99%) of subjects were HBeAg-positive at baseline, with a mean baseline ALT level of 71.5 U/L. Median HIV RNA level remained stable at approximately 2 log10 copies/mL through 24 weeks of blinded therapy. Virologic and biochemical endpoints at week 24 are shown in Table 9. There are no data in patients with HIV/HBV co-infection who have not received prior lamivudine therapy. Baraclude has not been evaluated in HIV/HBV co-infected patients who were not simultaneously receiving effective HIV treatment (see Warnings). (See Table 9.)\nFor subjects originally assigned to Baraclude, at the end of the open-label phase (week 48), 8% of subjects had HBV DNA <300 copies/mL by PCR, the mean change from baseline HBV DNA by PCR was -4.2 log10 copies/mL, and 37% of subjects with abnormal ALT at baseline had ALT normalization (=1 x ULN).\nOutcomes Beyond 48 Weeks: The optimal duration of therapy with Baraclude is unknown. According to protocol-mandated criteria in the phase III clinical trials, subjects discontinued Baraclude or lamivudine treatment after 52 weeks according to a definition of response based on HBV Virologic suppression (<0.7 mEq/mL by bDNA assay) and loss of HBeAg (in HBeAg-positive subjects) or ALT <1.25 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (in HBeAg-negative subjects) at week 48. Subjects who achieved virologic suppression but did not have serologic response (HBeAg-positive) or did not achieve ALT <1.25 x ULN (HBeAg-negative) continued blinded dosing through 96 weeks or until the response criteria were met. These protocol-specified subject management guidelines are not intended as guidance for clinical practice.\nNucleoside-Naive Subjects: Among nucleoside-naive, HBeAg-positive subjects (study AI463022), 243 (69%) Baraclude-treated subjects and 164 (46%) lamivudine-treated subjects continued blinded treatment for up to 96 weeks. Of those continuing blinded treatment in year 2, 180 (74%) Baraclude subjects and 60 (37%) lamivudine subjects achieved HBV DNA <300 copies/mL by PCR at the end of dosing (up to 96 weeks). 193 (79%) Baraclude subjects achieved ALT =1 x ULN compared to 112 (68%) lamivudine subjects, and HBeAg seroconversion occurred in 26 (11 %) Baraclude subjects and 20 (12%) lamivudine subjects.\nAmong nucleoside-naive, HBeAg-positive subjects, 74 (21%) Baraclude subjects and 67 (19%) lamivudine subjects met the definition of response at week 48, discontinued study drugs and were followed off treatment for 24 weeks. Among Baraclude responders, 26 (35%) subjects had HBV DNA <300 copies/mL, 55 (74%) subjects had ALT =1 x ULN, and 56 (76%) subjects sustained HBeAg seroconversion at the end of follow-up. Among lamivudine responders, 20 (30%) subjects had HBV DNA <300 copies/mL, 41 (61%) subjects had ALT =1xULN, and 47 (70%) subjects sustained HBeAg seroconversion at the end of follow-up.\nAmong nucleoside-naive, HBeAg-negative subjects (study AI463027), 26 (8%) Baraclude-treated subjects and 28 (9%) lamivudine-treated subjects continued blinded treatment for up to 96 weeks. In this small cohort continuing treatment in year 2, 22 Baraclude and 16 lamivudine subjects had HBV DNA <300 copies/mL by PCR, and 7 and 6 subjects, respectively, had ALT =1 x ULN at the end of dosing (up to 96 weeks).\nAmong nucleoside-naive, HBeAg-negative subjects, 275 (85%) Baraclude subjects and 245 (78%) lamivudine subjects met the definition of response at week 48, discontinued study drugs, and were followed off treatment for 24 weeks. In this cohort, very few subjects in each treatment arm had HBV DNA <300 copies/mL by PCR at the end of follow-up. At the end of follow-up, 126 (46%) Baraclude subjects and 84 (34%) lamivudine subjects had ALT =1 x ULN.\nLamivudine-Refractory Subjects: Among lamivudine-refractory subjects (Study AI463026), 77 (55%) Baraclude-treated subjects and 3 (2%) lamivudine subjects continued blinded treatment for up to 96 weeks. In this cohort of Baraclude subjects, 31 (40%) subjects achieved HBV DNA <300 copies/mL, 62 (81%) subjects had ALT =1 x ULN, and 8 (10%) subjects demonstrated HBeAg seroconversion at the end of dosing.",

      "indication": "As a bronchodilator for the prevention and treatment of symptoms in chronic obstructive airway disorders with reversible bronchospasm eg, bronchial asthma and especially chronic bronchitis with or without emphysema. Concomitant anti-inflammatory therapy should be considered for patients with bronchial asthma and steroid-responsive COPD.",
      "dosage": "The dosage should be adapted to the individual's requirements. Unless otherwise prescribed, the following dosages are recommended for adults and children >6 years: Acute Asthma Episodes: 2 actuations are sufficient for prompt symptomatic relief in many cases. In more severe cases, if breathing has not noticeably improved after 5 min, 2 further actuations may be taken. If an attack has not been relieved by 4 actuations, further actuations may be required. In these cases, patients should consult the physician or go to the nearest hospital immediately.\nIntermittent and Long-Term Treatment: (In asthma, Berodual metered dose aerosol should be used only on an as needed basis) 1-2 actuations for each administration, up to a maximum of 8 actuations/day (average of 1-2 actuations 3 times daily).\nIn children, Berodual metered aerosol should only be used upon medical advice and under the supervision of an adult.\nPatients should be instructed in the correct administration of the metered aerosol to ensure successful therapy.\nAdministration: Before first time use of the metered-dose aerosol, the following rules should be observed: Remove protective cap and depress the valve twice.\nBefore each use of the metered dose aerosol, the following rules should be observed: Remove protective cap (if the metered aerosol has not been used for >3 days, the valve has to be actuated once). Breathe out deeply. Hold the inhaler between the thumb and forefinger and close lips over the mouthpiece. The arrow and the base of the container should be pointing upwards. Breathe in as deeply as possible, pressing the base of the container firmly at the same time, this releases 1-metered-dose. Hold breath for a few secs, then remove the mouthpiece from the mouth and breathe out. The same action should be repeated for a second inhalation. Replace the protective cap after use.\nThe container is under pressure and should by no account be opened by force or exposed to temperatures exceeding 50°C. As the container is not transparent, it is impossible to see when the contents are used up, the inhaler will deliver 200 or, if available, 300 doses. When these have all been used, the container may still appear to contain a small amount of fluid.\nThe inhaler should, however, be replaced to get the right amount of treatment.\nThe approximate amount of treatment in your inhaler can be checked as follows: Shaking the container will show if there is any remaining fluid.\nAlternatively, remove the canister from the plastic mouthpiece and put into a container of water. The contents can be estimated by observing its position in the water. Clean your inhaler at least once a week. It is important to keep the mouthpiece of your inhaler clean to ensure that medicine does not build up and block the spray. For cleaning, first take off the dust cap and remove the canister from the inhaler. Rinse with warm water through the inhaler until no medication build-up and/or dirt is visible. After cleaning, shake out the inhaler and let it air-dry without using any heating system. Once the mouthpiece is dry, replace the canister and the dust can.",
      "over-dosage": "Symptoms: The effects of overdosage are expected to be primarily related to fenoterol.\nThe expected symptoms are those of excessive ß-adrenergic stimulation, the most prominent being tachycardia, palpitation, tremor, hypertension, hypotension, widening of the pulse pressure, anginal pain, arrhythmias and flushing.\nMetabolic acidosis has also been observed with fenoterol when applied in doses higher than recommended for the approved indications of Berodual. Expected symptoms of overdosage with ipratropium bromide (eg, dry mouth, visual accommodation disorder) are mild because the systemic availability of inhaled ipatropium is very low.\nTreatment: Administration of sedatives and tranquilizers, or in severe cases, intensive care treatment.\nBeta-receptor blockers, preferably ß1-selective, are suitable as specific antidotes; however, a possible increase in bronchial obstruction must be taken into account and the dose should be adjusted carefully in patients suffering from bronchial asthma or COPD because of the risk of precipitating severe bronchospasm, which may be fatal.",
      "contra-indications": "Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, tachyarrhythmia.\nHypersensitivity to fenoterol hydrobromide, atropine-like substances or inactive ingredients of Berodual.",
      "special-precautions": "When using Berodual metered-dose aerosol HFA for the first time, some patients may notice that the taste is slightly different from that of the CFC-containing metered-dose aerosol formulation. Patients should be made aware of this when changing from one formulation to the other. They should also be told that the formulations have been shown to be interchangeable for all practical purposes and that the difference in taste has no consequences in terms of the safety or the efficacy.\nIn the case of acute, rapidly worsening dyspnea (difficulty in breathing), a physician should be consulted immediately.\nProlonged Use: In patients with bronchial asthma, Berodual should be used only on an as needed basis. In patients with mild COPD, on demand treatment (symptom-oriented) may be preferable to use regularly. The addition or the increase of anti-inflammatory therapy to control airway inflammation and to prevent the deterioration of disease control should be considered for patients with bronchial asthma and steroid-responsive COPD.\nThe use of increasing amounts of ß2-agonists-containing products eg, Berodual on a regular basis to control symptoms of bronchial obstruction may suggest declining disease control. If bronchial obstruction deteriorates, it is inappropriate and possibly hazardous to simply increase the use of ß2-agonist-containing products eg, Berodual beyond the recommended dose over extended periods of time. In this situation, the patient's therapy plan and in particular, the adequacy of anti-inflammatory therapy with inhaled corticosteroids, should be reviewed to prevent potentially life-threatening deterioration of disease control.\nOther sympathomimetic bronchodilators should only be used with Berodual under strict medical supervision.\nIn the following conditions, Berodual should only be used after careful risk-benefit assessment, especially when doses higher than recommended are used: Insufficiently controlled diabetes mellitus, recent myocardial infarction, severe organic heart or vascular disorders, hyperthyroidism and pheochromocytoma.\nCardiovascular effects may be seen with sympathomimetic drugs, including Berodual. There is some evidence from post-marketing data and published literature of rare occurrences of myocardial ischaemia associated with ß-agonists. Patients with underlying severe heart disease (eg, ischaemic heart disease, arrhythmia or severe heart failure) who are receiving Berodual, should be warned to seek medical advice if they experience chest pain or other symptoms of worsening heart disease, attention should be paid to the assessment of symptoms eg, dyspnoea and chest pain, as they may be of either respiratory or cardiac origin. Potentially serious hypokalemia may result from ß2-agonist therapy.\nBerodual should be used with caution in patients predisposed to narrow-angled glaucoma, or with preexisting urinary outflow tract obstruction (eg, prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction).\nThere have been isolated reports of ocular complications (ie, mydriasis, increased intraocular pressure, narrow-angle glaucoma, eye pain) when aerosolized ipratropium bromide, either alone or in combination with an adrenergic ß2-agonist, has come in contact with. Thus, patients must be instructed in the correct administration of Berodual metered aerosol.\nEye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or coloured images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal oedema may be signs of acute narrow-angle glaucoma. Should any combination of these symptoms develop, treatment with miotic drops should be initiated and specialist advice sought immediately.\nPatients with cystic fibrosis may be more prone to gastrointestinal motility disturbances.\nImmediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of Berodual as demonstrated by rare cases of urticaria, angiooedema, rash, bronchospasm, oropharyngeal oedema and anaphylaxis.\nThe use of Berodual may lead to positive result with regard to fenoterol in tests for nonclinical substance abuse eg, in the context of athletic performance enhancement (doping).\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.\nHowever, patients should be advised that they may experience undesirable effects eg, dizziness, tremor accomodation disorder, mydriasis and blurred vision during treatment with Berodual. Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or operating machinery. If patients experience the above mentioned side effects, they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks eg, driving or operating machinery.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: Preclinical data, combined with available experience in humans, have shown no ill-effects in pregnancy of fenoterol or ipratropium. Nonetheless, the usual precautions regarding the use of drugs during pregnancy, especially during the 1st trimester should be exercised.\nThe inhibitory effect of Berodual on uterine contraction should be taken into account.\nPreclinical studies have shown that fenoterol hydrobromide is excreted into breast milk.\nIt is not known whether ipratropium is excreted in breast milk. But it is unlikely that ipratropium would reach the infant to an important extent, especially when taken by aerosol. However, because many drugs are excreted in breast milk, caution should be exercised when Berodual is administered to a nursing woman.\nClinical data on fertility are not available for the combination of ipratropium bromide and fenoterol hydrobromide. Preclinical studies performed with the individual components, ipratropium bromide and fenoterol hydrobromide, showed no adverse effect in fertility (see Toxicology).",
      "adverse-reactions": "Many of the listed undesirable effects can be assigned to the anticholinergic and ß-adrenergic properties of Berodual. As with all inhalation therapy, Berodual may show symptoms of local irritation. Adverse drug reactions were identified from data obtained in clinical trials and pharmacovigilance during post approval use of the drug.\nThe most frequent side effects reported in clinical trials were cough, dry mouth, headache, tremor, pharyngitis, nausea, dizziness, dysphonia, tachycardia, palpitations, vomiting, hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reactions, hypokalemia, nervousness, agitation, mental disorder, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, accommodation disorder, mydriasis, blurred vision, eye pain, corneal oedema, conjunctival hyperaemia, halo vision, increased heart rate, arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, myocardial ischaemia, cough, pharyngitis, bronchospasm, throat irritation, pharyngeal oedema, laryngospasm, paradoxical dry throat, stomatitis, glossitis, gastrointestinal motility disorder, diarrhoea, constipation, mouth oedema, urticaria, rash, pruritus, angioedema, hyperhidrosis, muscular weakness, muscle spasms, myalgia, urinary retention, systolic increased blood pressure, diastolic decreased blood pressure.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "Other ß-adrenergics, anticholinergics and xanthine derivatives (eg, theophylline) may enhance the bronchodilatory effect of Berodual. The concurrent administration of other ß-mimetics, systemically available anticholinergics and xanthine derivatives (eg, theophylline) may increase the side effects.\nA potentially serious reduction in bronchodilatation may occur during concurrent administration of ß-blockers.\nBeta-agonist-induced hypokalemia may be increased by concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, corticosteroids and diuretics. This should be taken into account particularly in patients with severe airway obstruction.\nHypokalemia may result in an increased susceptibility to arrhythmias in patients receiving digoxin. Additionally, hypoxia may aggravate the effects of hypokalemia on cardiac rhythm. It is recommended that serum potassium levels are monitored in such situations.\nBeta-adrenergic agonists should be administered with caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, since the action of ß-adrenergic agonists may be enhanced.\nInhalation of halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics eg, halothane, trichloroethylene and enflurane may increase the susceptibility on the cardiovascular effects of ß-agonists.",

      "description": "Each metered-dose (puff) contains ipratropium bromide, (8r)-3a-hydroxy-8-isopropyl-1aH,5aH-tropanium bromide (±)-tropate monohydrate 21 mcg corresponding to 20 mcg anhydrous ipratropium bromide and fenoterol HBr, 1-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-[[1-(4-hydroxybenzyl)-ethyl]-amino]-ethanol hydrobromide 50 mcg.",
      "mechanism": "Trials with treatment duration of up to 3 months involving adult asthmatics and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, and asthmatic children, in which the hydrofluroalkane (HFA) formulation and the chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) formulation have been compared, have shown the 2 formulations to be therapeutically equivalent.\nBerodual contains 2 active bronchodilating ingredients: Ipratropium bromide, exhibiting an anticholinergic effect and fenoterol HBr, a ß-adrenergic agent.\nIpratropium bromide: Quaternary ammonium compound with anticholinergic (parasympatholytic) properties. In preclinical studies, it inhibits vagally mediated reflexes by antagonizing the action of acetylcholine, the transmitter agent released from the vagus nerve. Anticholinergics prevent the increase in intracellular concentration of Ca++ caused by interaction of acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptor on bronchial smooth muscle, Ca++ release is mediated by the 2nd messenger system consisting of IP3 (inositol triphosphate) and DAG (diacylglycerol).\nThe bronchodilatation following inhalation of ipatropium bromide is primarily a local, site-specific effect, not a systemic one.\nPreclinical and clinical evidence suggest no deleterious effect of ipratropium bromide on airway mucous secretion, mucociliary clearance or gas exchange.\nFenoterol hydrobromide: Direct-acting sympathomimetic agent, selectively stimulating ß2-receptors in the therapeutic dose range. The stimulation of ß1-receptors comes into effect at a higher dose range (eg, as administered in tocolysis). Occupation of ß2-receptors activates adenyl cyclase via a stimulatory GS-protein. The increase in cyclic AMP activates protein kinase A which then phosphorylates target proteins in smooth muscle cells. This in turn leads to the phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase, inhibition of phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and the opening of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels.\nFenoterol hydrobromide relaxes bronchial and vascular smooth muscle and protects against bronchoconstricting stimuli eg, histamine, methacholine, cold air and allergen (early response). After acute administration, the release of bronchoconstricting and pro-inflammatory mediators from mast cells is inhibited. Further, an increase in mucociliary clearance has been demonstrated after administration of doses of fenoterol (0.6 mg).\nHigher plasma concentrations, which are more frequently achieved with oral, or even more so, with IV administration, inhibit uterine motility. Also, at higher doses, metabolic effects are observed: Lipolysis, glycogenolysis, hyperglycemia and hypokalemia, the latter caused by increased K+-uptake primarily into skeletal muscle. Beta-adrenergic effects on the heart eg, increased heart rate and contractility are caused by the vascular effects of fenoterol, cardiac ß2-receptor stimulation, and at supratherapeutic doses, by ß1-receptor stimulation. As with other ß-adrenergic agents, QT prolongations have been reported. For fenoterol MDIs, these were discrete and observed at doses higher than recommended. However, systemic exposure after administration with nebulisers (UDVs, solution for inhalation) might be higher than with recommended metered dose inhalers (MDI) doses. The clinical significance has not been established. Tremor is a more frequently observed effect of ß-agonists. Unlike the effects on the bronchial smooth muscle, the systemic effects of ß-agonists are subject to the development of tolerance.\nConcurrent use of these 2 active ingredients dilates the bronchi by affecting different pharmacological sites of action. The 2 active substances, thus, complement each other in their spasmolytic action on the bronchial muscles and allow a broad therapeutic use in the field of bronchopulmonary disorders associated with constriction of the respiratory tract. The complementary action is such that only a very low proportion of the ß-adrenergic component is needed to obtain the desired effect, facilitating individual dosage suited to each patient with a minimum of adverse reactions.\nIn patients with asthma and with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), better efficacy compared to its components ipatropium or fenoterol was demonstrated. Two studies (1 with asthma patients, 1 with COPD patients) have shown that Berodual is as efficacious as double the dose of fenoterol administered without ipratropium but was better tolerated in cumulative dose response studies.\nIn acute bronchoconstriction, Berodual is effective shortly after administration and is, therefore, also suitable for treating acute attacks of asthma.",

      "dosage": "Metered Aerosol: Acute Asthma Episodes: 1 puff is sufficient for prompt symptomatic relief in many cases. If breathing has not noticeably improved after 5 min, a 2nd dose may be taken.\nIf an attack has not been relieved by 2 puffs, further puffs may be required. In these cases, patients should consult the doctor or the nearest hospital immediately.\nProphylaxis of Exercise-Induced Asthma: 1-2 puffs for each administration, up to a maximum of 8 puffs/day.\nBronchial Asthma and Other Conditions with Reversible Airways Narrowing: If repeated dosing is required, 1-2 puffs for each administration, up to a maximum of 8 puffs/day.\nAdministration: The correct operation of the metered aerosol is essential for successful therapy.\nDepress the valve twice before the apparatus is used for the 1st time.\nBefore each use, the following rules should be observed: Remove protective cap. Breathe out deeply. Hold the metered aerosol and close lips over the mouthpiece. The arrow and the base of the container should be pointing upwards. Breathe in as deeply as possible, pressing the base of the container firmly at the same time, this releases 1 metered dose. Hold breath for a few seconds, then remove the mouthpiece from the mouth and breathe out. If a 2nd inhalation is required, the same action should be repeated. Replace the protective cap after use. After not using the metered aerosol for 3 days, the valve has to be actuated once.\nThe container is not transparent. It is, therefore, not possible to see when it is empty. The metered-dose aerosol will deliver 200 doses. When these have all been used, the metered-aerosol may still appear to contain a small amount of fluid. The metered-dose aerosol should, however, be replaced because it may not get the right amount of treatment.\nThe amount of treatment in the metered aerosol can be checked as follows: Remove the metered aerosol from the plastic mouthpiece and put the metered-aerosol into a container of water.\nClean the metered aerosol at least once a week. It is important to keep the mouthpiece of the metered-aerosol clean to ensure that medicine does not build up and block the spray.\nFor cleaning, first take off the dust cap and remove the canister from the inhaler. Rinse warm water through the metered aerosol until no medication build-up and/or dirt is visible. After cleaning, shake the metered aerosol and let it air-dry without using any heating system. Once the mouthpiece is dry, replace the canister and the dust cap.\nWarning: The plastic mouthpiece has been specially designed for use with Berotec 100 mcg to ensure in getting the right amount of the medicine. The mouthpiece must never be used with any other metered aerosol nor must Berotec 100 mcg be used with any mouthpiece other than the one supplied.\nThe container is under pressure and should by no account be opened by force or exposed to temperatures above 50°C.\nInhalation Solution: (20 drops=1 mL) (1 drop=50 mcg fenoterol HBr).\nThe dosage should be adapted to the individual requirements of the patient; patients should also be kept under medical supervision during treatment.\nUnless otherwise prescribed, the following doses are recommended:\nAdults (Including the Elderly) and Adolescent >12 years: Acute Asthma Episodes: 0.5 mL (10 drops=0.5 mg fenoterol HBr) are sufficient for immediate symptomatic relief in many cases.\nIn severe cases eg, in most patients admitted to the emergency room, higher doses between 1 and 1.25 mL (20-25 drops=1-1.25 mg fenoterol HBr) may be required.\nFor particular severe cases, up to 2 mL (40 drops=2 mg fenoterol HBr) may be administered under medical supervision.\nProphylaxis of Exercise-Induced Asthma: 0.5 mL (10 drops=0.5 mg fenoterol HBr) for each administration up to 4 times daily.\nBronchial Asthma and Other Conditions with Reversible Airways Narrowing: If repeated dosing is required, 0.5 mL (10 drops=0.5 mg fenoterol HBr) for each administration up to 4 times daily.\nChildren 6-12 years (22-36 kg body weight): Acute Asthma Episodes: 0.25-0.5 mL (5-10 drops=0.25-0.5 mg fenoterol HBr) are sufficient for immediate symptomatic relief in many cases.\nIn severe cases, higher doses up to 1 mL (20 drops=1 mg fenoterol HBr) may be required.\nFor particular severe cases, up to 1.5 mL (30 drops=1.5 mg fenoterol HBr) may be administered under medical supervision.\nProphylaxis of Exercise-Induced Asthma: 0.5 mL (10 drops=0.5 mg fenoterol HBr) for each administration up to 4 times daily.\nBronchial Asthma and Other Conditions with Reversible Airways Narrowing: If repeated dosing is required, 0.5 mL (10 drops=0.5 mg fenoterol HBr) for each administration up to 4 times daily.\nChildren <6 years (<22 kg body weight): Because there is limited information in this age group, the following dose is recommended to be given under medical supervision only: About 50 mcg/kg body weight/dose (5-20 drops=0.25-1 mg fenoterol HBr) up to 3 times daily.\nAdministration: Treatment should usually be started with the lowest recommended dose.\nThe recommended dose is to be diluted with physiological saline to a final volume of 3-4 mL and nebulised and inhaled until the solution is consumed. Berotec Solution 0.1% may however, not be diluted with distilled water.\nThe solution should be rediluted each time before use and residual diluted solution should be discarded.\nDosage may be dependent upon the mode of inhalation and the characteristics of the nebuliser used.

They should also be told that the formulations have been shown to be interchangeable for all practical purposes and that the difference in taste have no consequences in terms of the safety or the efficacy of the new formulation.\nOther sympathomimetic bronchodilators should only be used with Berotec HFA 100 mcg/Berotec Solution 0.1% under strict medical supervision. Anticholinergic bronchodilators may, however, be inhaled at the same time.\nIn the following conditions, Berotec HFA 100 mcg/Berotec Solution 0.1% should only be used after careful risk/benefit assessment, especially when doses higher than recommended are used: Insufficiently controlled diabetes mellitus, recent myocardial infarction, severe organic heart or vascular disorders, hyperthyroidism and phaeochromocytoma.\nIn the case of acute, rapidly worsening dyspnea (difficulty in breathing), a physician should be consulted immediately.\nProlonged Use: On demand (symptom-oriented) treatment is preferable to regular use. Patients must be evaluated for the addition or the increase of anti-inflammatory therapy (eg, inhaled corticosteroids) to control airway inflammation and to prevent long-term lung damage.\nIf bronchial obstruction deteriorates, it is inappropriate and possibly hazardous to simply increase the use of ß2-agonist-containing drugs eg, Berotec HFA 100 mcg/Berotec Solution 0.1% beyond the recommended dose over extended periods of time. The use of increasing amounts of ß2-agonist-containing products like Berotec HFA 100 mcg/Berotec Solution 0.1% on regular basis to control symptoms of bronchial obstruction may suggest declining disease control. In this situation, the patient's therapy plan and, in particular, the adequacy of anti-inflammatory therapy, should be reviewed to prevent potentially life-threatening deterioration of disease control.\nPotentially serious hypokalemia may result from ß2-agonist therapy.

It has been shown that these components may cause bronchoconstriction in some patients.\nThe use of Berotec may lead to positive results on fenoterol in tests for nonclinical substance abuse eg, in the context of athletic performance enhancement (doping).\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, patients should be advised that symptoms eg, dizziness have been reported in clinical trials. Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or operating machinery. If patients experience such symptoms, they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks eg, driving or operating machinery.\nImpairment of Fertility: Clinical data in fertility are not available for fenoterol. Nonclinical studies performed with fenoterol showed no adverse effect on fertility (see Toxicology).\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: Preclinical data, combined with available experience in humans, have shown no evidence of ill effects in pregnancy. Nonetheless, the usual precautions regarding the use of drugs during pregnancy, especially during the 1st trimester, should be exercised.\nThe inhibitory effect of fenoterol on uterine contraction should be taken into account.\nPreclinical studies have shown that fenoterol is excreted into breast milk.

      "mechanism": "Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Anti-vertigo preparations. ATC Code: N07CA01.\nPharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: The mechanism of action of betahistine is partly known.\nIn biochemical studies, betahistine was found to have weak H1 receptor agonistic and potent H3 antagonistic properties in the CNS and autonomic nervous system. Pharmacological testing in animals has shown that the blood circulation in the striae vascularis of the inner ear improves, probably by means of a relaxation of the precapillary sphincters of the microcirculation of the inner ear.\nBetahistine was also found to have a dose dependent inhibiting effect on spike generation of neurons in lateral and medial vestibular nuclei.\nBetahistine accelerates the vestibular recovery after unilateral neurectomy, by promoting and facilitating central vestibular compensation; this effect, which is characterized by an up-regulation of histamine turnover and release, is mediated through the H3 receptor antagonism.\nTaken together, these properties contribute to the beneficial therapeutic effects of betahistine in Meniere's disease and vestibular vertigo.\nBetahistine increases histamine turnover and release by blocking presynaptic H3-receptors and inducing H3-receptor down regulation. This effect on the histaminergic system provides explanation for the efficacy of betahistine in the treatment of vertigo and vestibular diseases.\nPharmacokinetics: Orally administered betahistine is readily and almost completely absorbed from all parts of the gastrointestinal tract. After absorption, the drug is rapidly and almost completely metabolized into 2-PAA (which has no pharmacological activity). Plasma levels of betahistine are very low (i.e., below the detection limit of 100 pg/ml). All pharmacokinetic analyses are therefore based on 2-PAA measurements in plasma and urine.\nThe plasma concentration of 2-PAA reaches its maximum 1 hour after intake. The half-life of approximately 3.5 hours. 2-PAA is readily excreted in the urine. In the dose range between 8 and 48 mg, about 85% of the original dose is recovered in the urine. Renal or fecal excretion of betahistine itself is of minor importance. Recovery rates are constant over the oral dose range of 8-48 mg indicating that the pharmacokinetics of betahistine are linear, and suggesting that the involved metabolic pathway is not saturated. Under fed conditions, Cmax is lower compared to fasted conditions. However, total absorption of betahistine is similar under both conditions, indicating that food intake only slows down the absorption of betahistine.\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: Oral dosing up to and above 250 mg/kg in dogs and in rats, respectively, of betahistine dihydrochloride administered during 3 months did not result in adverse effects. Side effects in the nervous system were seen in dogs and baboons after intravenous doses at and above 120 mg/kg. Emesis was observed at 300 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg following oral and IV dosing, respectively, in dogs and sporadically in baboons.\nBetahistine has not shown any mutagenic effect.",

      "dosage": "The dose should be individualised according to the patient profile (see Precautions) and blood pressure response.\nHypertension: Bioprexum may be used in monotherapy or in combination with other classes of antihypertensive therapy. Recommended Dose: 5 mg once daily in the morning.\nPatients with a strongly activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (in particular, renovascular hypertension, salt- and/or volume-depletion, cardiac decompensation or severe hypertension) may experience an excessive drop in blood pressure following the initial dose. A starting dose of 2.5 mg is recommended in such patients and the initiation of treatment should take place under medical supervision. The dose may be increased to 10 mg once daily after 1 month of treatment.\nSymptomatic hypotension may occur following initiation of therapy with Bioprexum; this is more likely in patients who are being treated concurrently with diuretics. Caution is therefore recommended since these patients may be volume- and/or salt-depleted.\nIf possible, the diuretic should be discontinued 2-3 days before beginning therapy with Bioprexum (see Precautions).\nHypertensive Patients in Whom the Diuretic Cannot be Discontinued: Therapy with Bioprexum should be initiated with a 2.5-mg dose. Renal function and serum potassium should be monitored. The subsequent dosage of Bioprexum should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. If required, diuretic therapy may be resumed.\nElderly: Treatment should be initiated at a dose of 2.5 mg which may be progressively increased to 5 mg after 1 month, then to 10 mg if necessary depending on renal function.\nSymptomatic Heart Failure: It is recommended that Bioprexum, generally associated with a nonpotassium-sparing diuretic and/or digoxin and/or a ß-blocker, be introduced under close medical supervision with a recommended starting dose of 2.5 mg taken in the morning. This dose may be increased after 2 weeks to 5 mg once daily if tolerated. The dose adjustment should be based on the clinical response of the individual patient.\nIn severe heart failure and in other patients considered to be at high risk (patients with impaired renal function and a tendency to have electrolyte disturbances, patients receiving simultaneous treatment with diuretics and/or treatment with vasodilating agents), treatment should be initiated under careful supervision (see Precautions).\nPatients at high risk of symptomatic hypotension eg, patients with salt depletion with or without hyponatraemia, patients with hypovolaemia or patients who have been receiving vigorous diuretic therapy, should have these conditions corrected, if possible, prior to therapy with Bioprexum. Blood pressure, renal function and serum potassium should be monitored closely, both before and during treatment with Bioprexum (see Precautions).\nStable Coronary Artery Disease: Initially 5 mg once daily for 2 weeks, then increased to 10 mg once daily, depending on renal function and provided that the 5 mg dose is well tolerated.\nElderly: Elderly patients should receive 2.5 mg once daily for 1 week, then 5 mg once daily the next week, before increasing the dose up to 10 mg once daily depending on renal function. The dose should be increased only if the previous lower dose is well tolerated.\nRenal Impairment: Dosage in patients with renal impairment should be based on creatinine clearance (CrCl).\nCrCl =60 mL/min: 5 mg/day, >30 to <60 mL/min: 2.5 mg/day, >15 to <30 mL/min: 2.5 mg every other day.\nHaemodialysed Patients* (CrCl <15 mL/min): 2.5 mg on the day of dialysis.\n*Dialysis clearance of perindoprilat is 70 mL/min. For patients on haemodialysis, the dose should be taken after dialysis.\nHepatic Impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions and Precautions).\nAdministration: It is recommended that Bioprexum be taken once daily in the morning before a meal.",
      "over-dosage": "Symptoms: Limited data are available for overdosage in humans. Symptoms associated with overdosage of ACE inhibitors may include hypotension, circulatory shock, electrolyte disturbances, renal failure, hyperventilation, tachycardia, palpitations, bradycardia, dizziness, anxiety and cough.\nTreatment: The recommended treatment of overdosage is IV infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride 9 mg/mL solution. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the shock position. If available, treatment with angiotensin II infusion and/or IV catecholamines may also be considered. Perindopril may be removed from the general circulation by haemodialysis (see Precautions). Pacemaker therapy is indicated for therapy-resistant bradycardia. Vital signs, serum electrolytes and creatinine concentrations should be monitored continuously.",
      "administration": "Should be taken on an empty stomach: Take before meals.",
      "contra-indications": "Known hypersensitivity to perindopril, to any of the excipients of Bioprexum or to any other ACE inhibitor; history of angioedema associated with previous ACE inhibitor therapy; hereditary or idiopathic angioedema; 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy (see Use in pregnancy and lactation under Precautions).",
      "special-precautions": "Stable Coronary Artery Disease: If an episode of unstable angina pectoris (major or not) occurs during the 1st month of perindopril treatment, a careful appraisal of the benefit/risk should be performed before treatment continuation.\nHypotension: ACE inhibitors may cause a fall in blood pressure. Symptomatic hypotension is seen rarely in uncomplicated hypertensive patients and is more likely to occur in patients who have been volume-depleted eg, by diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhoea or vomiting, or who have severe renin-dependent hypertension (see Adverse Reactions and Interactions). In patients with symptomatic heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, symptomatic hypotension has been observed. This is most likely to occur in those patients with more severe degrees of heart failure, as reflected by the use of high doses of loop diuretics, hyponatraemia or functional renal impairment. In patients at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension, initiation of therapy and dose adjustment should be closely monitored (see Dosage and Administration and Adverse Reactions). Similar considerations apply to patients with ischaemic heart or cerebrovascular disease in whom an excessive fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident.\nIf hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and if necessary, should receive an IV infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride 9 mg/mL solution. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further doses, which can be given usually without difficulty once the blood pressure has increased after volume expansion.\nIn some patients with congestive heart failure who have normal or low blood pressure, additional lowering of systemic blood pressure may occur with Bioprexum.\nThis effect is anticipated and is usually not a reason to discontinue treatment. If hypotension becomes symptomatic, a reduction of dose or discontinuation of Bioprexum may be necessary.\nAortic and Mitral Valve Stenosis/Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: As with other ACE inhibitors, Bioprexum should be given with caution to patients with mitral valve stenosis and obstruction in the outflow of the left ventricle eg, aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\nRenal Impairment: In cases of renal impairment (CrCl <60 mL/min), the initial perindopril dosage should be adjusted according to the patient's CrCl (see Dosage and Administration) and then as a function of the patient's response to treatment. Routine monitoring of potassium and creatinine are part of normal medical practice for these patients (see Adverse Reactions).\nIn patients with symptomatic heart failure, hypotension following the initiation of therapy with ACE inhibitors may lead to some further impairment in renal function. Acute renal failure, usually reversible, has been reported in this situation.\nIn some patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney, who have been treated with ACE inhibitors, increases in blood urea and serum creatinine, usually reversible upon discontinuation of therapy, have been seen. This is especially likely in patients with renal insufficiency. If renovascular hypertension is also present, there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency. In these patients, treatment should be started under close medical supervision with low doses and careful dose titration. Since treatment with diuretics may be a contributory factor to the above, they should be discontinued and renal function should be monitored during the 1st weeks of Bioprexum therapy.\nSome hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when Bioprexum has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of the diuretic and/or Bioprexum may be required.\nHaemodialysis Patients: Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialysed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or different class of antihypertensive agent.\nKidney Transplantation: There is no experience regarding the administration of Bioprexum in patients with a recent kidney transplantation.\nHypersensitivity/Angioedema: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis and/or larynx has been reported rarely in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including Bioprexum (see Adverse Reactions). This may occur at any time during therapy.\nIn such cases, Bioprexum should promptly be discontinued and appropriate monitoring should be initiated and continued until complete resolution of symptoms has occurred. In those instances where swelling was confined to the face and lips, the condition generally resolved without treatment, although antihistamines have been useful in relieving symptoms.\nAngioedema associated with laryngeal oedema may be fatal. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, emergency therapy should be administered promptly. This may include the administration of adrenaline and/or the maintenance of a patent airway. The patient should be under close medical supervision until complete and sustained resolution of symptoms has occurred.\nPatients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor (see Contraindications).\nIntestinal angioedema has been reported rarely in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan, or ultrasound or at surgery and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor.\nIntestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain.\nAnaphylactoid Reactions During Low-Density Lipoproteins (LDL) Apheresis: Rarely, patients receiving ACE inhibitors during LDL apheresis with dextran sulphate have experienced life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. These reactions were avoided by temporarily withholding ACE inhibitor therapy prior to each apheresis.\nAnaphylactic Reactions During Desensitisation: Patients receiving ACE inhibitors during desensitisation treatment (eg, hymenoptera venom) have experienced anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions have been avoided when the ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge.\nHepatic Failure: Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up (see Adverse Reactions).\nNeutropenia/Agranulocytosis/Thrombocytopenia/Anaemia: Neutropenia/agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia and anaemia have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors. In patients with normal renal function and no other complicating factors, neutropenia occurs rarely. Perindopril should be used with extreme caution in patients with collagen vascular disease, immunosuppressant therapy, treatment with allopurinol or procainamide, or a combination of these complicating factors, especially if there is preexisting impaired renal function. Some of these patients developed serious infections, which in a few instances did not respond to intensive antibiotic therapy. If perindopril is used in such patients, periodic monitoring of white blood cell counts is advised and patients should be instructed to report any sign of infection (eg, sore throat, fever).\nRace: ACE inhibitors cause a higher rate of angioedema in Blacks than in non-Blacks. As with other ACE inhibitors, perindopril may be less effective in lowering blood pressure in Blacks than in non-Blacks, possibly because of a higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population.\nCough: Cough has been reported with the use of ACE inhibitors. Characteristically, the cough is non-productive, persistent and resolves after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis of cough.\nSurgery/Anaesthesia: In patients undergoing major surgery or during anaesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, Bioprexum may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. The treatment should be discontinued 1 day prior to the surgery. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.\nHyperkalaemia: Elevations in serum potassium have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including perindopril. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalaemia include those with renal insufficiency, worsening of renal function, >70 years, diabetes mellitus, intercurrent events, in particular dehydration, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic acidosis and concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene or amiloride), potassium supplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes; or those patients taking other drugs associated with increases in serum potassium (eg, heparin). The use of potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics or potassium-containing salt substitutes particularly in patients with impaired renal function may lead to a significant increase in serum potassium. Hyperkalaemia can cause serious, sometimes fatal arrhythmias. If concomitant use of the previously-mentioned agents is deemed appropriate, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium (see Interactions).\nDiabetic Patients: In diabetic patients treated with oral antidiabetic agents or insulin, glycaemic control should be closely monitored during the 1st month of treatment with an ACE inhibitor (see Interactions).\nLithium: The combination of lithium and perindopril is generally not recommended (see Interactions).\nPotassium-Sparing Diuretics, Potassium Supplements or Potassium-Containing Salt Substitutes: The combination of perindopril and potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes is generally not recommended (see Interactions).\nExcipients: Due to the presence of lactose, patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption, or the Lapp-lactase deficiency should not take this medicinal product.\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: Bioprexum has no direct influence on the ability to drive and use machines but individual reactions related to low blood pressure may occur in some patients, particularly at the start of treatment or in combination with another antihypertensive medication.\nAs a result, the ability to drive or operate machinery may be impaired.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: The use of ACE inhibitors is not recommended during the 1st trimester of pregnancy. The use of ACE inhibitors is contraindicated during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy.\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the 1st trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however, a small increase in risk cannot be excluded. Unless continued ACE inhibitor therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with ACE inhibitors should be stopped immediately and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.\nExposure to ACE inhibitor therapy during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters is known to induce human foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see Toxicology under Actions). Should exposure to ACE inhibitor have occurred from the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended. Infants whose mothers have taken ACE inhibitors should be closely observed for hypotension (see Contraindications).\nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Bioprexum during breastfeeding, Bioprexum is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breastfeeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or pre-term infant.\nUse in children and adolescents <18 years: Efficacy and safety of use in children and adolescents have not been established. Therefore, use in children and adolescents is not recommended.",
      "adverse-reactions": "The following adverse reactions have been observed during treatment with perindopril and ranked under the following frequencies: Very common (1/10); common (1/100, <1/10); uncommon (1/1000, <1/100); rare (1/10,000, <1/1000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\nBlood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia/neutropenia and cases of agranulocytosis or pancytopenia, have been reported very rarely. In patients with a congenital deficiency of G6PDH, very rare cases of haemolytic anaemia have been reported (see Precautions).\nMetabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Not Known: Hypoglycaemia (see Precautions and Interactions).\nPsychiatric Disorders: Uncommon: Mood or sleep disturbances.\nNervous System Disorders: Common: Headache, dizziness, vertigo, paraesthesia. Very Rare: Confusion.\nEye Disorders: Common: Visual disturbance.\nEar and Labyrinth Disorders: Common: Tinnitus.\nCardiac Disorders: Very Rare: Arrhythmia, angina pectoris and myocardial infarction, possibly secondary to excessive hypotension in high-risk patients (see Precautions).\nVascular Disorders: Common: Hypotension and effects related to hypotension. Very Rare: Stroke, possibly secondary to excessive hypotension in high-risk patients (see Precautions). Not Known: Vasculitis.\nRespiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Common: Cough, dyspnoea. Uncommon: Bronchospasm. Very Rare: Eosinophilic pneumonia, rhinitis.\nGastrointestinal Disorders: Common: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, constipation. Uncommon: Dry mouth. Very Rare: Pancreatitis.\nHepatobiliary Disorders: Very Rare: Hepatitis either cytolytic or cholestatic (see Precautions).\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Common: Rash, pruritus. Uncommon: Angioedema of face, extremities, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis and/or larynx, urticaria (see Precautions). Very Rare: Erythema multiforme.\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Common: Muscle cramps.\nRenal and Urinary Disorders: Uncommon: Renal insufficiency. Very Rare: Acute renal failure.\nReproductive System and Breast Disorders: Uncommon: Impotence.\nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Common: Asthenia. Uncommon: Sweating.\nInvestigations: Increases in blood urea and plasma creatinine, hyperkalaemia reversible on discontinuation may occur, especially in the presence of renal insufficiency, severe heart failure and renovascular hypertension. Elevation of liver enzymes and serum bilirubin have been reported rarely.\nClinical Trials: During the randomised period of the EUROPA study, only serious adverse events were collected. Few patients experienced serious adverse events: 16 (0.3%) of the 6122 perindopril patients and 12 (0.2%) of the 6107 placebo patients. In the perindopril-treated patients, hypotension was observed in 6 patients, angioedema in 3 patients and sudden cardiac arrest in 1 patient. More patients withdrew for cough, hypotension or other intolerance on perindopril than on placebo, 6.0% (n=366) versus 2.1% (n=129) respectively.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "Diuretics: Patients on diuretics and especially those who are volume- and/or salt-depleted, may experience excessive reduction in blood pressure after initiation of therapy with an ACE inhibitor. The possibility of hypotensive effects can be reduced by discontinuation of the diuretic, by increasing volume or salt intake prior to initiating therapy with low and progressive doses of perindopril.\nPotassium-Sparing Diuretics, Potassium Supplements or Potassium-Containing Salt Substitutes: Although serum potassium usually remains within normal limits, hyperkalaemia may occur in some patients treated with perindopril. Potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, triamterene or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium. Therefore, the combination of perindopril with the previously-mentioned drugs is not recommended (see Precautions). If concomitant use is indicated because of demonstrated hypokalaemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.\nLithium: Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with ACE inhibitors. Concomitant use of thiazide diuretics may increase the risk of lithium toxicity and enhance the already increased risk of lithium toxicity with ACE inhibitors. Use of perindopril with lithium is not recommended, but if the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels should be performed (see Precautions).\nNonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Including Aspirin =3 g/day: When ACE inhibitors are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs (ie, acetylsalicylic acid at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and nonselective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur. Concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure and an increase in serum potassium, especially in patients with poor preexisting renal function. The combination should be administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and periodically thereafter.\nAntihypertensive Agents and Vasodilators: Concomitant use of these agents may increase the hypotensive effects of perindopril. Concomitant use with nitroglycerin and other nitrates, or other vasodilators, may further reduce blood pressure.\nAntidiabetic Agents: Epidemiological studies have suggested that concomitant administration of ACE inhibitors and antidiabetic medicines (insulins, oral hypoglycaemic agents) may cause an increased blood-glucose lowering effect with risk of hypoglycaemia. This phenomenon appeared to be more likely to occur during the 1st weeks of combined treatment and in patients with renal impairment.\nTricyclic Antidepressants/Antipsychotics/Anaesthetics: Concomitant use of certain anaesthetic medicinal products, tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics with ACE inhibitors may result in further reduction of blood pressure (see Precautions).\nSympathomimetics: Sympathomimetics may reduce the antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors.\nAcetylsalicylic Acid, Thrombolytics, ß-Blockers, Nitrates: Perindopril may be used concomitantly with acetylsalicylic acid (when used as a thrombolytic), thrombolytics, ß-blockers and/or nitrates.\nGold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including perindopril.\nIncompatibilities: Not applicable.",

      "mechanism": "Pharmacotherapeutic Group: ACE inhibitor, plain. ATC Code: C09AA04.\nPharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: Perindopril is an inhibitor of the enzyme that converts angiotensin I into angiotensin II [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)]. The converting enzyme, or kinase, is an exopeptidase that allows conversion of angiotensin I into the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II as well as causing the degradation of the vasodilator bradykinin into an inactive heptapeptide. Inhibition of ACE results in a reduction of angiotensin II in the plasma, which leads to increased plasma renin activity (by inhibition of the negative feedback of renin release) and reduced secretion of aldosterone. Since ACE inactivates bradykinin, inhibition of ACE also results in an increased activity of circulating and local kallikrein-kinin systems (and thus also activation of the prostaglandin system). It is possible that this mechanism contributes to the blood pressure-lowering action of ACE inhibitors and is partially responsible for certain of their side effects (eg, cough).\nPerindopril acts through its active metabolite, perindoprilat. The other metabolites show no inhibition of ACE activity in vitro.\nHypertension: Perindopril is active in all grades of hypertension: Mild, moderate, severe; a reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures in both supine and standing positions is observed.\nPerindopril reduces peripheral vascular resistance, leading to blood pressure reduction. As a consequence, peripheral blood flow increases, with no effect on heart rate. Renal blood flow increases as a rule, while the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is usually unchanged. The antihypertensive activity is maximal between 4 and 6 hrs after a single dose and is sustained for at least 24 hrs: Trough effects are about 87-100% of peak effects.\nThe decrease in blood pressure occurs rapidly. In responding patients, normalisation is achieved within a month and persists without the occurrence of tachyphylaxis.\nDiscontinuation of treatment does not lead to a rebound effect.\nPerindopril reduces left ventricular hypertrophy.\nIn man, perindopril has been confirmed to demonstrate vasodilatory properties. It improves large artery elasticity and decreases the media:lumen ratio of small arteries.\nAn adjunctive therapy with a thiazide-diuretic produces an additive-type of synergy. The combination of an ACE inhibitor and a thiazide also decreases the risk of hypokalaemia induced by the diuretic treatment.\nHeart Failure: Perindopril reduces cardiac work by a decrease in pre- and afterload. Studies in patients with heart failure have demonstrated decreased left and right ventricular filling pressures, reduced total peripheral vascular resistance, increased cardiac output and improved cardiac index.\nIn comparative studies, the 1st administration of perindopril arginine 2.5 mg to patients with mild to moderate heart failure was not associated with any significant reduction of blood pressure as compared to placebo.\nPatients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease: The EUROPA trial was a multicentre, international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial lasting 4 years.\nTwelve thousand two hundred and eighteen (12,218) patients >18 years were randomised to perindopril tert-butylamine 8 mg (equivalent to perindopril arginine 10 mg) (n=6110) or placebo (n=6108).\nThe trial population had evidence of coronary artery disease with no evidence of clinical signs of heart failure. Overall, 90% of the patients had a previous myocardial infarction and/or a previous coronary revascularisation. Most of the patients received the study medication on top of conventional therapy including platelet inhibitors, lipid-lowering agents and ß-blockers.\nThe main efficacy criterion was the composite of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction and/or cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation. The treatment with perindopril tert-butylamine 8 mg (equivalent to perindopril arginine 10 mg) once daily resulted in a significant absolute reduction in the primary endpoint of 1.9% [relative risk reduction (RRR) of 20%, 95% CI (9.4; 28.6); p<0.001].\nIn patients with a history of myocardial infarction and/or revascularisation, an absolute reduction of 2.2% corresponding to a RRR of 22.4% [95% CI (12.0; 31.6); p<0.001] in the primary endpoint was observed by comparison to placebo.\nPharmacokinetics: After oral administration, the absorption of perindopril is rapid and the peak concentration is achieved within 1 hr. The plasma half-life of perindopril is equal to 1 hr.\nPerindopril is a prodrug. Twenty-seven percent (27%) of the administered perindopril dose reaches the bloodstream as the active metabolite perindoprilat. In addition to active perindoprilat, perindopril yields 5 metabolites, all inactive. The peak plasma concentration of perindoprilat is achieved within 3-4 hrs.\nAs ingestion of food decreases conversion to perindoprilat, hence bioavailability, perindopril arginine should be administered orally in a single daily dose in the morning before a meal.\nIt has been demonstrated a linear relationship between the dose of perindopril and its plasma exposure.\nThe volume of distribution is approximately 0.2 L/kg for unbound perindoprilat. Protein-binding of perindoprilat to plasma proteins is 20%, principally to ACE, but is concentration-dependent.\nPerindoprilat is eliminated in the urine and the terminal half-life of the unbound fraction is approximately 17 hrs, resulting in steady-state within 4 days.\nElimination of perindoprilat is decreased in the elderly and also in patients with heart or renal failure. Dosage adjustment in renal insufficiency is desirable depending on the degree of impairment (creatinine clearance).\nDialysis clearance of perindoprilat is equal to 70 mL/min.\nPerindopril kinetics are modified in patients with cirrhosis. Hepatic clearance of the parent molecule is reduced by half. However, the quantity of perindoprilat formed is not reduced and therefore, no dosage adjustment is required (see Dosage and Administration and Precautions).\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: In the chronic oral toxicity studies (rats and monkeys), the target organ is the kidney, with reversible damage.\nNo mutagenicity has been observed in in vitro or in vivo studies.\nReproduction toxicology studies (rats, mice, rabbits and monkeys) showed no sign of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. However, ACE inhibitors, as a class, have been shown to induce adverse effects on late foetal development, resulting in foetal death and congenital effects in rodents and rabbits. Renal lesions and an increase in peri- and postnatal mortality have been observed.\nNo carcinogenicity has been observed in long-term studies in rats and mice.",

History of angioedema (Quincke's edema) associated with previous ACE inhibitor therapy. Hereditary/idiopathic angioedema. 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy (see Use in pregnancy and lactation under Precautions).\nIndapamide: Hypersensitivity to indapamide or to any other sulphonamides. Severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min). Hepatic encephalopathy. Severe hepatic impairment. Hypokalemia. As a general rule, indapamide is inadvisable in combination with non-antiarrhythmic agents causing Torsades de pointes (see Interactions). Lactation (see Use in pregnancy and lactation under Precautions).\nWarnings Perindopril and Indapamide: Lithium: The combination of lithium and the combination of perindopril and indapamide is usually not recommended (see Interactions).\nPerindopril: Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis: Neutropenia/agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia and anemia have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors. In patients with normal renal function and no other complicating factors, neutropenia occurs rarely. Perindopril should be used with extreme caution in patients with collagen vascular disease, immunosuppressant therapy, treatment with allopurinol or procainamide, or a combination of these complicating factors, especially if there is preexisting impaired renal function. Some of these patients developed serious infections which in a few instances did not respond to intensive antibiotic therapy. If perindopril is used in such patients, periodical monitoring of white blood cell counts is advised and patients should be instructed to report any sign of infection (eg, sore throat, fever).\nHypersensitivity/Angioedema: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx has been reported rarely in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including perindopril. This may occur at any time during treatment. In such cases perindopril should be discontinued promptly and appropriate monitoring should be instituted to ensure complete resolution of symptoms prior to dismissing the patient. In those instances where swelling has been confined to the face and lips, generally resolved without treatment, although antihistamines have been useful in relieving symptoms.\nAngioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, which may include epinephrine SC solution 1:1000 (0.3-0.5 mL) and/or measures to ensure a patent airway, should be administered promptly.\nBlack patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-Blacks.\nPatients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor (see Contraindications).\nIntestinal angioedema has been reported rarely in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases, there was no prior facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound or at surgery and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain.\nAnaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization: There have been isolated reports of patients experiencing sustained, life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions while receiving ACE inhibitors during desensitization treatment with hymenoptera (bees, wasps) venom. Angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors should be used with caution in allergic patients treated with desensitization and avoided in those undergoing venom immunotherapy. However these reactions could be prevented by temporary withdrawal of ACE inhibitor for at least 24 hrs before treatment in patients who require both ACE inhibitors and desensitization.\nAnaphylactoid Reactions During LDL-Apheresis: Rarely, patients receiving ACE inhibitors during low density lipoprotein (LDL)-apheresis with dextran sulphate have experienced life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. These reactions were avoided by temporarily withholding ACE inhibitor therapy prior to each apheresis.\nHemodialysis Patients: Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialysed with high-flux membranes (eg, AN 69) and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of antihypertensive agent.\nPotassium-Sparing Diuretics, Potassium Salts: The combination of perindopril and potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium salts is usually not recommended (see Interactions).\nUse in Pregnancy and Lactation: Angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued ACE inhibitor therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with ACE inhibitors should be stopped immediately and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see Contraindications and Use in pregnancy and lactation under Precautions).\nUse of perindopril is not recommended during breastfeeding.\nIndapamide: When liver function is impaired, thiazide diuretics and thiazide-related diuretics may cause hepatic encephalopathy. Administration of the diuretic should be stopped immediately if this occurs.\nPhotosensitivity: Cases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported with thiazides and thiazide-related diuretics (see Adverse Reaction). If photosensitivity reaction occurs during treatment, it is recommended to stop the treatment. If a readministration of the diuretic is deemed necessary, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA.",
      "special-precautions": "Perindopril and Indapamide: Renal Impairment: In cases of severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min), treatment is contraindicated.\nIn certain hypertensive patients without preexisting apparent renal lesions and for whom renal blood tests show functional renal insufficiency, treatment should be stopped and possibly restarted either at a low dose or with 1 constituent only.\nIn these patients, usual medical follow-up will include frequent monitoring of potassium and creatinine, after 2 weeks of treatment and then every 2 months during therapeutic stability period. Renal failure has been reported mainly in patients with severe heart failure or underlying renal failure including renal artery stenosis.\nBioprexum Plus is usually not recommended in case of bilateral renal artery stenosis or a single functioning kidney.\nHypotension and Water and Electrolyte Depletion: There is a risk of sudden hypotension in the presence of preexisting sodium depletion (particularly in individuals with renal artery stenosis). Therefore systematic testing should be carried out for clinical signs of water and electrolyte depletion, which may occur with an intercurrent episode of diarrhea or vomiting. Regular monitoring of plasma electrolytes should be carried out in such patients.\nMarked hypotension may require the implementation of an IV infusion of isotonic saline.\nTransient hypotension is not a contraindication to continuation of treatment. After re-establishment of a satisfactory blood volume and blood pressure, treatment can be started again either at a reduced dose or with only 1 of the constituents.\nPotassium Levels: The combination of perindopril and indapamide does not prevent the onset of hypokalaemia particularly in diabetic patients or in patients with renal failure. As with any antihypertensive agent containing a diuretic, regular monitoring of plasma potassium levels should be carried out.\nBioprexum Plus should not be administered to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp-lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.\nPerindopril: Cough: A dry cough has been reported with the use of ACE inhibitors. It is characterized by its persistence and disappearance when treatment is withdrawn. An iatrogenic etiology should be considered in the event of this symptom. If the prescription of an ACE inhibitor is still preferred, continuation of treatment may be considered.\nPatients with Known Atherosclerosis: The risk of hypotension exists in all patients but particular care should be taken in patients with ischaemic heart disease or cerebral circulatory insufficiency, with treatment being started at a low dose.\nRenovascular Hypertension: The treatment for renovascular hypertension is revascularization. Nonetheless, ACE inhibitors can be beneficial in patients presenting with renovascular hypertension who are awaiting corrective surgery or when such a surgery is not possible.\nIf Bioprexum Plus is prescribed to patients with known or suspected renal artery stenosis, treatment should be started in a hospital setting at a low dose and renal function and potassium levels should be monitored, since some patients have developed a functional renal insufficiency which was reversed when treatment was stopped.\nOther Populations: In patients with severe cardiac insufficiency (grade IV) or in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (spontaneous tendency to increased levels of potassium), treatment should be started under medical supervision with a reduced initial dose. Treatment with ß-blockers in hypertensive patients with coronary insufficiency should not be stopped, the ACE inhibitor should be added to the ß-blocker.\nDiabetic Patients: The glycaemia levels should be closely monitored in diabetic patients previously treated with oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin, namely during the 1st month of treatment with an ACE inhibitor.\nEthnic Differences: As with other ACE inhibitors, perindopril is apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in Black people than in non-Blacks, possibly because of a higher prevalence of low-renin states in the Black hypertensive population.\nSurgery/Anesthesia: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can cause hypotension in cases of anaesthesia, especially when the anesthetic administered is an agent with hypotensive potential.\nIt is therefore recommended that treatment with long-acting ACE inhibitors eg, perindopril should be discontinued where possible 1 day before surgery.\nAortic or Mitral Valve Stenosis/Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with an obstruction in the outflow tract of the left ventricle.\nHepatic Failure: Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and, sometimes, death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up (see Adverse Reaction).\nHyperkalaemia: Elevations in serum potassium have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including perindopril. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalaemia include those with renal insufficiency, worsening of renal function, age (>70 years), diabetes mellitus, intercurrent events, in particular dehydration, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic acidosis and concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene or amiloride), potassium supplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes; or those patients taking other drugs associated with increases in serum potassium (eg, heparin). The use of potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics or potassium-containing salt substitutes particularly in patients with impaired renal function may lead to a significant increase in serum potassium. Hyperkalaemia can cause serious, sometimes fatal arrhythmias. If concomitant use of the previously mentioned agents is deemed appropriate, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium (see Interactions).\nUse in children and adolescents: The efficacy and tolerability of perindopril in children and adolescents, alone or in combination, have not been established.\nRisk of Arterial Hypotension and/or Renal Insufficiency (In Cases of Cardiac Insufficiency, Water and Electrolyte Depletion, etc.): Marked stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has been observed particularly during marked water and electrolyte depletions (strict sodium-free diet or prolonged diuretic treatment), in patients whose blood pressure was initially low, in cases of renal artery stenosis, congestive heart failure or cirrhosis with edema and ascites.\nThe blocking of this system with an ACE inhibitor may therefore cause, particularly at the time of the 1st administration and during the 1st 2 weeks of treatment, a sudden drop in blood pressure and/or an increase in plasma levels of creatinine, showing a functional renal insufficiency. Occasionally this can be acute in onset, although rare and with a variable time to onset. In such cases, the treatment should then be initiated at a lower dose and increased progressively.\nUse in the elderly: Renal function and potassium levels should be tested before the start of treatment. The initial dose is subsequently adjusted according to blood pressure response, especially in cases of water and electrolyte depletion, in order to avoid sudden onset of hypotension.\nIndapamide: Water and Electrolyte Balance: Sodium Levels: These should be tested before treatment is started, then at regular intervals. All diuretic treatment can cause a reduction in sodium levels, which may have serious consequences. Reduction in sodium levels can be initially asymptomatic and regular testing is therefore essential. Testing should be more frequent in elderly and cirrhotic patients (see Overdosage and Adverse Reaction).\nPotassium Levels: Potassium depletion with hypokalemia is a major risk with thiazide diuretics and thiazide-related diuretics. The risk of onset of lowered potassium levels (<3.4 mmol/L) should be prevented in some high risk populations eg, elderly and/or malnourished subjects, whether or not they are taking multiple medications, cirrhotic patients with edema and ascites, coronary patients and patients with heart failure.\nIn such cases, hypokalemia increases the cardiac toxicity of cardiac glycosides and the risk of rhythm disorders.\nSubjects presenting with a long QT interval are also at risk, whether the origin is congenital or iatrogenic. Hypokalemia, as with bradycardia, acts as a factor which favors the onset of severe rhythm disorders, in particular Torsades de pointes, which may be fatal.\nIn all cases, more frequent testing of potassium levels is necessary. The 1st measurement of plasma potassium levels should be carried out during the 1st week following the start of treatment.\nIf low potassium levels are detected, correction is required.\nCalcium Levels: Thiazide diuretics and thiazide-related diuretics may reduce urinary excretion of calcium and cause a mild and transient increase in plasma calcium levels. Markedly raised levels of calcium may be related to undiagnosed hyperparathyroidism. In such cases, the treatment should be stopped before investigating the parathyroid function.\nBlood Glucose: Monitoring of blood glucose is important in diabetic patients, particularly when potassium levels are low.\nUric Acid: Tendency to gout attacks may be increased in hyperuricaemic patients.\nRenal Function and Diuretics: Thiazide diuretics and thiazide-related diuretics are only fully effective when renal function is normal or only slightly impaired (creatinine levels lower than approximately 25 mg/L ie, 220 micromol/L for an adult).\nIn the elderly, the value of plasma creatinine levels should be adjusted to take account of the age, weight and sex of the patient, according to the Cockroft formula:\nCrCl = (140 - age) x body weight/0.814 x plasma creatinine level.\nWith age expressed in years, body weight in kg and plasma creatinine level in micromol/L. This formula is suitable for an elderly male and should be adapted for women by multiplying the result by 0.85.\nHypovolemia, resulting from the loss of water and sodium caused by the diuretic at the start of treatment, causes a reduction in glomerular filtration. It may result in an increase in blood urea and creatinine levels. This transitory functional renal insufficiency is of no adverse consequence in patients with normal renal function but may however worsen a preexisting renal impairment.\nAthletes: Athletes should note that Bioprexum Plus contains an active substance which may cause a positive reaction in doping tests.\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: Neither perindopril, indapamide nor Bioprexum Plus affect alertness but individual reactions related to low blood pressure may occur in some patients, particularly at the start of treatment or in combination with another antihypertensive medication.\nAs a result, the ability to drive or operate machinery may be impaired.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: Perindopril: The use of ACE inhibitors is not recommended during the 1st trimester of pregnancy. The use of ACE inhibitors is contraindicated during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy (see Contraindications).\nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the 1st trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however, a small increase in risk cannot be excluded. Unless continued ACE inhibitor therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with ACE inhibitors should be stopped immediately and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.\nExposure to ACE inhibitor therapy during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters is known to induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See Toxicology under Actions.)\nShould exposure to ACE inhibitors have occurred from the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended.\nInfants whose mothers have taken ACE inhibitors should be closely observed for hypotension (see Contraindications).\nIndapamide: Prolonged exposure to thiazide during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy can reduce maternal plasma volume as well as uteroplacental blood flow, which may cause a fetoplacental ischemia and growth retardation. Moreover, rare cases of hypoglycemia and thrombocytopenia in neonates have been reported following exposure near term.\nBioprexum Plus is contraindicated during lactation.\nUse of perindopril is not recommended during breastfeeding.\nIndapamide is excreted in human milk. Indapamide is closely related to thiazide diuretics which have been associated, during breastfeeding, with decrease or even suppression of milk lactation. Hypersensitivity to suphonamide-derived drugs, hypokalaemia and nuclear icterus might occur.\nAs with both drugs, serious adverse reactions might occur in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue therapy taking account the importance of this to the mother.",
      "adverse-reactions": "The administration of perindopril inhibits the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and tends to reduce the potassium loss caused by indapamide. Four percent (4%) of the patients on treatment with Bioprexum Plus experience hypokalemia (potassium level <3.4 mmol/L).\nThe following undesirable effects could be observed during treatment and ranked under the following frequency: Very common (>1/10); common (>1/100, <1/10); uncommon (>1/1000, <1/100); rare (>1/10,000, <1/1000), very rare (<1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\nBlood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Very Rare: Thrombocytopenia, leucopenia/neutropenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia, hemolytic anaemia.\nAnaemia has been reported with ACE inhibitors in specific circumstances (patients who have had kidney transplants, patients undergoing hemodialysis). (See Precautions.)\nPsychiatric Disorders: Uncommon: Mood or sleep disturbances.\nNervous System Disorders: Common: Paraesthesia, headache, asthenia, feelings of dizziness, vertigo. Very Rare: Confusion.\nEye Disorders: Common: Visual disturbance.\nEar and Labyrinth Disorders: Common: Tinnitus.\nVascular Disorders: Common: Hypotension, whether orthostatic or not (see Precautions).\nCardiac Disorders: Very Rare: Arrhythmia including bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, angina pectoris and myocardial infarction possibly secondary to excessive hypotension in high-risk patients (see Precautions).\nRespiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Common: A dry cough has been reported with the use of ACE inhibitors. It is characterised by its persistence and disappearance when treatment is withdrawn. An iatrogenic etiology should be considered in the presence of this symptom. Dyspnea. Uncommon: Bronchospasm. Very Rare: Eosinophilic pneumonia, rhinitis.\nGastrointestinal Disorders: Common: Constipation, dry mouth, nausea, epigastric pain, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, taste disturbance, dyspepsia, diarrhea. Very Rare: Pancreatitis.\nHepatobiliary Disorders: Very Rare: Hepatitis either cytolytic or cholestatic (see Precautions). Not Known: In case of hepatic insufficiency, there is a possibility of onset of hepatic encephalopathy (see Contraindications and Precautions).\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Common: Rash, pruritus, maculopapular eruptions. Uncommon: Angioedema of face, extremities, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis and/or larynx, urticaria (see Precautions). Hypersensitivity reactions, mainly dermatological, in subjects with a predisposition to allergic and asthmatic reactions; purpura. Possible aggravation of preexisting acute disseminated lupus erythematosus. Very Rare: Erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Cases of photosensitivity reactions have been reported (see Precautions).\nMusculoskeletal, Connective Tissue and Bone Disorders: Common: Cramps.\nRenal and Urinary Disorders: Uncommon: Renal insufficiency. Very Rare: Acute renal failure.\nReproductive System and Breast Disorders: Uncommon: Impotence.\nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Common: Asthenia. Uncommon: Sweating.\nInvestigations: Potassium depletion with particularly serious reduction in levels of potassium in some at risk populations (see Precautions). Reduced sodium levels with hypovolemia causing dehydration and orthostatic hypotension. Increase in uric acid levels and in blood glucose levels during treatment. Slight increase in urea and in plasma creatinine levels, reversible when treatment is stopped. This increase is more frequent in cases of renal artery stenosis, arterial hypertension treated with diuretics, renal insufficiency. Increased levels of potassium, usually transitory. Rare: Raised plasma calcium levels.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "Perindopril and Indapamide: Concomitant Use Not Recommended: Lithium: Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with ACE inhibitors. Concomitant use of thiazide diuretics may further increase lithium levels and enhance the risk of lithium toxicity with ACE inhibitors. Use of perindopril combined with indapamide with lithium is not recommended, but if the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels should be performed (see Precautions).\nConcomitant Use which Requires Special Care: Baclofen: Potentiation of antihypertensive effect. Monitoring of blood pressure and renal function and antihypertensive dose-adaptation if necessary.\nNonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Including Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA) at High Doses: When ACE inhibitors are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs (ie, ASA at anti-inflammatory dosage regimens, COX-2 inhibitors and nonselective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur. Concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure and an increase in serum potassium, especially in patients with poor preexisting renal function. The combination should be administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and periodically thereafter.\nConcomitant Use which Requires Some Care: Imipramine-Like Antidepressants (Tricyclics), Neuroleptics: Increased antihypertensive effect and risk of orthostatic hypotension (additive effect).\nCorticosteroids, Tetracosactide: Reduction in antihypertensive effect (salt and water retention due to corticosteroids).\nOther Antihypertensive Agents: Use of other antihypertensive medicinal products with perindopril/indapamide could result in additional blood pressure lowering effect.\nPerindopril: Concomitant Use Not Recommended: Potassium-Sparing Diuretics (Spironolactone, Triamterene, Alone or In Combination), Potassium (Salts): Angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors attenuate diuretic-induced potassium loss. Potassium-sparing diuretics eg, spironolactone, triamterene or amiloride, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium (potentially lethal). If concomitant use is indicated because of documented hypokalaemia they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium and by electrocardiogram (ECG).\nConcomitant Use which Requires Special Care: Antidiabetic Agents (Insulin, Hypoglycemic Sulphonamides): Reported with captopril and enalapril.\nThe use of ACE inhibitors may increase the hypoglycemic effect in diabetics receiving treatment with insulin or with hypoglycaemic sulphonamides. The onset of hypoglycaemic episodes is very rare (improvement in glucose tolerance with a resulting reduction in insulin requirements).\nConcomitant Use which Requires Some Care: Allopurinol, Cytostatic or Immunosuppressive Agents, Systemic Corticosteroids or Procainamide: Concomitant administration with ACE inhibitors may lead to an increased risk for leukopenia.\nAnaesthetic Drugs: Angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors may enhance the hypotensive effects of certain anaesthetic drugs.\nDiuretics (Thiazide or Loop Diuretics): Prior treatment with high-dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and in a risk of hypotension when initiating therapy with perindopril.\nGold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including perindopril.\nIndapamide: Concomitant Use which Requires Special Care: Torsade de Pointes-Inducing Drugs: Due to the risk of hypokalaemia, indapamide should be administered with caution when associated with medicinal products that induce Torsade de pointes eg, class IA antiarrhythmic agents (quinidine, hydroquinidine, disopyramide); class III antiarrhythmic agents (amiodarone, dofetilide, ibutilide, bretylium, sotalol); some neuroleptics (chlorpromazine, cyamemazine, levomepromazine, thioridazine, trifluoperazine), benzamides (amisulpride, sulpiride, sultopride, tiapride), butyrophenones (droperidol, haloperidol), other neuroleptics (pimozide); other substances such as bepridil, cisapride, diphemanil, IV erythromycin, halofantrine, mizolastine, moxifloxacin, pentamidine, sparfloxacin, vincamine IV, methadone, astemizole, terfenadine. Prevention of low potassium levels and correction if necessary by monitoring of the QT interval.\nPotassium-Lowering Drugs: Amphotericin B (IV route), glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (systemic route), tetracosactide, stimulant laxatives cause increased risk of low potassium levels (additive effect). Monitoring of potassium levels and correction if necessary; particular consideration required in cases of treatment with cardiac glycosides. Nonstimulant laxatives should be used.\nCardiac Glycosides: Low potassium levels favor the toxic effects of cardiac glycosides. Potassium levels and ECG should be monitored and treatment reconsidered if necessary.\nConcomitant Use which Requires Some Care: Metformin: Lactic acidosis due to metformin caused by possible functional renal insufficiency linked to diuretics and in particular to loop diuretics. Do not use metformin when plasma creatinine levels >15 mg/L (135 micromol/L) in men and 12 mg/L (110 micromol/L) in women.\nIodinated Contrast Media: In cases of dehydration caused by diuretics, there is an increased risk of acute renal insufficiency, particularly when high doses of iodinated contrast media are used. Rehydration should be carried out before the iodinated compound is administered.\nCalcium (Salts): Risk of increased levels of calcium due to reduced elimination of calcium in the urine.\nCiclosporin: Risk of increased creatinine levels with no change in circulating levels of ciclosporin, even when there is no salt and water depletion.",

Film-Coating: Glycerol (E422), hypromellose (E464), macrogol 6000, magnesium stearate (E470B) and titanium dioxide (E171).",
      "mechanism": "Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Perindopril and diuretics. ATC Code: C09BA04.\nPharmacology: Mechanism of Action: Bioprexum Plus produces an additive synergy of the antihypertensive effects of the two components.\nPharmacodynamics: Bioprexum Plus is a combination of perindopril arginine salt, an ACE inhibitor and indapamide, a chlorosulphamoyl diuretic. Its pharmacological properties are derived from those of each of the components taken separately, in addition to those due to the additive synergistic action of the 2 products when combined.\nPerindopril: Perindopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a vasoconstricting substance; in addition, the enzyme stimulates the secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex and the degradation of bradykinin, a vasodilatory substance, into inactive heptapeptides.\nThis results in a reduction in aldosterone secretion; an increase in plasma renin activity, since aldosterone no longer exercises negative feedback; and a reduction in total peripheral resistance with a preferential action on the vascular bed in muscle and the kidney, with no accompanying salt and water retention or reflex tachycardia, with chronic treatment.\nThe antihypertensive action of perindopril also occurs in patients with low or normal renin concentrations.\nPerindopril acts through its active metabolite, perindoprilat. The other metabolites are inactive.\nPerindopril reduces the work of the heart by a vasodilatory effect on veins, probably caused by changes in the metabolism of prostaglandins, therefore having a reduction in preload; by reduction of the total peripheral resistance, therefore having a reduction in afterload.\nStudies carried out on patients with cardiac insufficiency have shown a reduction in left and right ventricular filling pressures and total peripheral vascular resistance, an increase in cardiac output and regional blood flow in muscle and an improvement in the cardiac index. Exercise test results also showed improvement.\nIndapamide: Indapamide is a sulphonamide derivative with an indole ring, pharmacologically related to the thiazide group of diuretics. Indapamide inhibits the reabsorption of sodium in the cortical dilution segment. It increases the urinary excretion of sodium and chlorides and to a lesser extent, the excretion of potassium and magnesium, thereby increasing urine output and having an antihypertensive action.\nCharacteristics of Antihypertensive Action: Bioprexum Plus: In hypertensive patients regardless of age, Bioprexum Plus exerts a dose-dependent antihypertensive effect on diastolic and systolic arterial pressure whilst supine or standing. This antihypertensive effect lasts for 24 hrs. The reduction in blood pressure is obtained in <1 month without tachyphylaxis; stopping treatment has no rebound effect. During clinical trials, the concomitant administration of perindopril and indapamide produced antihypertensive effects of a synergistic nature in relation to each of the products administered alone.\nPICXEL, a multicenter, randomised, double-blind active controlled study has assessed on echocardiography the effect of perindopril/indapamide combination on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) versus enalapril monotherapy.\nIn PICXEL, hypertensive patients with LVH, defined as left ventricular mass index (LVMI) >120 g/m2 in male and >100 g/m2 in female) were randomised either to perindopril tert-butylamine 2 mg (equivalent to perindopril arginine 2.5 mg)/indapamide 0.625 mg or to enalapril 10 mg once a day for a 1-year treatment. The dose was adapted according to blood pressure control, up to perindopril tert-butylamine 8 mg (equivalent to perindopril arginine 10 mg) and indapamide 2.5 mg or enalapril 40 mg once a day. Only 34% of the subjects remained treated with perindopril tert-butylamine 2 mg (equivalent to perindopril arginine 2.5 mg)/indapamide 0.625 mg (versus 20% with enalapril 10 mg).\nAt the end of treatment, LVMI had decreased significantly more in the perindopril/indapamide group (-10.1 g/m2) than in the enalapril group (-1.1 g/m2) in all the randomised patients population. The between group difference in LVMI change was -8.3 [95% CI (-11.5, -5), p<0.0001].\nA better effect on LVMI was reached with higher perindopril/indapamide doses than those licensed for Bioprexum Plus.\nRegarding blood pressure, the estimated mean between group differences in the randomised population were -5.8 mm Hg [95% CI (-7.9, -3.7), p<0.0001] for systolic blood pressure and -2.3 mm Hg [95% CI (-3.6, -0.9), p=0.0004] for diastolic blood pressure respectively, in favor of the perindopril/indapamide group.\nPerindopril: Perindopril is active in all grades of hypertension, from mild to moderate or severe. A reduction in systolic and diastolic arterial pressure is observed in the lying and standing position.\nThe antihypertensive activity after a single dose is maximal between 4 and 6 hrs and is maintained over 24 hrs.\nThere is a high degree of residual blocking of ACE at 24 hrs, approximately 80%.\nIn patients who respond, normalized blood pressure is reached after 1 month and is maintained without tachyphylaxis.\nWithdrawal of treatment has no rebound effect on hypertension.\nPerindopril has vasodilatory properties and restores elasticity of the main arterial trunks, corrects histomorphometric changes in resistance arteries and produces a reduction in LVH.\nIf necessary, the addition of a thiazide diuretic leads to an additive synergy.\nThe combination of an ACE inhibitor with a thiazide diuretic decreases the hypokalemia risk associated with the diuretic alone.\nIndapamide: Indapamide, as monotherapy, has an antihypertensive effect which lasts for 24 hrs. This effect occurs at doses at which the diuretic properties are minimal.\nIts antihypertensive action is proportional to an improvement in arterial compliance and a reduction in total and arteriolar peripheral vascular resistance.\nIndapamide reduces left ventricular hypertrophy.\nWhen a dose of thiazide diuretic and thiazide-related diuretics is exceeded, the antihypertensive effect reaches a plateau, whereas the adverse effects continue to increase. If the treatment is ineffective, the dose should not be increased.\nFurthermore, it has been shown that in the short-term, mid-term and long-term treatment in hypertensive patients, indapamide has no effect on lipid metabolism eg, triglycerides, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol and carbohydrate metabolism, even in diabetic hypertensive patients.\nPharmacokinetics: The co-administration of perindopril and indapamide does not change their pharmacokinetic properties by comparison to separate administration.\nPerindopril: After oral administration, the absorption of perindopril is rapid and the peak concentration is achieved within 1 hr. The plasma half-life of perindopril is equal to 1 hr.\nPerindopril is a prodrug. Twenty seven percent (27%) of the administered perindopril dose reaches the bloodstream as the active metabolite perindoprilat. In addition to active perindoprilat, perindopril yields 5 metabolites, all inactive. The peak plasma concentration of perindoprilat is achieved within 3-4 hrs.\nAs ingestion of food decreases conversion to perindoprilat, hence bioavailability, perindopril arginine should be administered orally in a single daily dose in the morning before a meal.\nA linear relationship between the dose of perindopril and its plasma exposure has been demonstrated.\nThe volume of distribution is approximately 0.2 L/kg for unbound perindoprilat. Protein-binding of perindoprilat to plasma proteins is 20%, principally to ACE, but is concentration-dependent.\nPerindoprilat is eliminated in the urine and the terminal half-life of the unbound fraction is approximately 17 hrs, resulting in steady state within 4 days.\nElimination of perindoprilat is decreased in the elderly and also in patients with heart or renal failure. Dosage adjustment in renal insufficiency is desirable depending on the degree of impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCl)].\nDialysis clearance of perindoprilat is equal to 70 mL/min.\nPerindopril kinetics are modified in patients with cirrhosis because hepatic clearance of the parent molecule is reduced by half. However, the quantity of perindoprilat formed is not reduced and therefore no dosage adjustment is required (see Dosage and Administration and Precautions).\nIndapamide: Indapamide is rapidly and completely absorbed from the digestive tract.\nThe peak plasma level is reached in humans approximately 1 hr after oral administration of the product. Plasma protein-binding is 79%.\nThe elimination half-life is between 14 and 24 hrs (average of 18 hrs). Repeated administration does not produce accumulation. Elimination is mainly in the urine (70% of the dose) and feces (22%) in the form of inactive metabolites.\nThe pharmacokinetics are unchanged in patients with renal insufficiency.\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: Bioprexum Plus has slightly increased toxicity than that of its components. Renal manifestations do not seem to be potentiated in the rat. However, the combination produces gastrointestinal toxicity in the dog and the toxic effects on the mother seem to be increased in the rat (compared to perindopril).\nNonetheless, these adverse effects are shown at dose levels corresponding to a very marked safety margin by comparison to the therapeutic doses used.\nPreclinical studies performed separately with perindopril and indapamide did not show genotoxic, carcinogenic or teratogenic potential.",

The maximum antihypertensive effect is attained within 4 weeks after initiation of treatment.\nChildren: The safety and efficacy of Blopress have not been established in children.\nElderly: No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients up to 75 year. In patients >75 years, an initial dose of 2 mg once daily is recommended. The dose may be titrated up according to response.\nImpaired Renal Function: No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment. In patients with moderate to severe renal impairment, an initial dose 2 mg once daily is recommended. The dose may be titrated up according to response.\nImpaired Hepatic Function: An initial dose of 2 mg once daily is recommended in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The dose may be titrated up according to response. There is no experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\nConcomitant Therapy: Blopress may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.\nHeart Failure: The usual recommended initial dose of Blopress is 4 mg once daily. Up-titration to the target dose of 32 mg once daily or the highest tolerated dose is done by doubling the dose at intervals of at least 2 weeks.\nSpecial Patient Populations: No initial dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or in patients with intravascular volume depletion, renal impairment or mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\nConcomitant Therapy: Blopress can be administered with other heart failure treatment, including ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics and digitalis or a combination of these medicinal products.\nAdministration: Blopress should be taken once daily with or without food.",

In individual case reports of overdose (of up to 672 mg candesartan cilexetil), patient recovery was uneventful.\nManagement: If symptomatic hypotension should occur, symptomatic treatment should be instituted and vital signs monitored. The patient should be placed supine with the legs elevated. If this is not sufficient, plasma volume should be increased by infusion of, e.g. isotonic saline solution. Sympathomimetic drugs may be administered if the previously mentioned measures are not sufficient.\nBlopress is not removed by haemodialysis.",

      "special-precautions": "Renal Impairment: As with other agents inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible patients treated with Blopress.\nWhen Blopress is used in hypertensive patients with renal impairment, periodic monitoring of serum potassium and creatinine levels is recommended. There is limited experience in patients with very severe or end-stage renal impairment (Clcreatinine <15 ml/min). In these patients Blopress should be carefully titrated with thorough monitoring of blood pressure.\nEvaluation of patients with heart failure should include periodic assessments of renal function, especially in elderly patients 75 years or older, and patients with impaired renal function. During dose titration of Blopress, monitoring of serum creatinine and potassium is recommended. Clinical trials in heart failure did not include patients with serum creatinine >265 µmol/L (>3 mg/dl).\nConcomitant Therapy with an ACE Inhibitor in Heart Failure: The risk of adverse events, especially renal function impairment and hyperkalaemia, may increase when Blopress is used in combination with an ACE inhibitor. Patients with such treatment should be monitored regularly and carefully.\nHemodialysis: During dialysis the blood pressure may be particularly sensitive to AT1-receptor blockade as a result of reduced plasma volume and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Therefore, Blopress should be carefully titrated with thorough monitoring of blood pressure in patients on haemodialysis.\nRenal Artery Stenosis: Other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, may increase blood urea and serum creatinine in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney. A similar effect may be anticipated with angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\nKidney Transplantation: There is no experience regarding the administration of Blopress in patients with a recent kidney transplantation.\nHypotension: Hypotension may occur during treatment with Blopress in heart failure patients. As described for other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, it may also occur in hypertensive patients with intravascular volume depletion such as those receiving high dose diuretics. Caution should be observed when initiating therapy and correction of hypovolemia should be attempted.\nAnaesthesia and Surgery: Hypotension may occur during anaesthesia and surgery in patients treated with angiotensin II antagonists due to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Very rarely, hypotension may be severe such that it may warrant the use of intravenous fluids and/or vasopressors.\nAortic and Mitral Valve Stenosis (Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy): As with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from haemodynamically relevant aortic or mitral valve stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\nPrimary Hyperaldosteronism: Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism will not generally respond to antihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Therefore, the use of Blopress is not recommended.\nHyperkalaemia: Based on experience with the use of other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, concomitant use of Blopress with potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increase in serum potassium in hypertensive patients.\nIn heart failure patients treated with Blopress, hyperkalaemia may occur. During treatment with Blopress in patients with heart failure, periodic monitoring of serum potassium is recommended, especially when taken concomitantly with ACE inhibitors and potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone.\nGeneral: In patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with other medicinal products that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension, azotaemia, oluguria or, rarely, acute renal failure. The possibility of similar effects cannot be excluded with angiotensin II receptor antagonists. As with any antihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cerebrovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\nEffects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines: The effect of candesartan on the ability to drive and use machines has not been studied but based on its pharmacodynamic properties is unlikely to affect this ability. When driving vehicles or operating machines it should be taken into account that dizziness or weariness may occur during treatment.\nUse In Pregnancy and Lactation Use in Pregnancy: There are very limited data from the use of Blopress in pregnant woman. These data are insufficient to allow conclusions about potential risk for the foetus when used during the first trimester. In humans, foetal renal perfusion, which is dependent upon the development of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, begins in the second trimester. Thus, risk to the foetus increases if Blopress is administered during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. When used in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters, medicinal products that acts directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause foetal and neonatal injury (hypotension, renal dysfunction, oliguria and/or anuria, oligohydramnios, skull hypoplasia, intrauterine growth retardation) and death. Cases of lung hypoplasia, facial abnormalities and limb contractures have also been described.\nAnimal studies with candesartan cilexetil have demonstrated late foetal and neonatal injury in the kidney. The mechanism is believed to be pharmacologically mediated through effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\nBased on the above information, Blopress should not be used in pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected during treatment, Blopress should be discontinued.\nUse in Lactation: It is not known whether candesartan is excreted in human milk. However, candesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, Blopress should not be given during breast-feeding.",
      "adverse-reactions": "Treatment of Hypertension: In controlled clinical studies, adverse events were mild and transient and comparable to placebo. The overall incidence of adverse events showed no association with dose or age.\nWithdrawals from treatment due to adverse events were similar with candesartan cilexetil (3.1%) and placebo (3.2%).\nIn a pooled analysis of clinical trial data, the following common (>1/100) adverse reactions with candesartan cilexetil were reported based on an incidence of adverse events with at least 1% higher than the incidence seen with placebo: Nervous System Disorders: Dizziness/vertigo, headache.\nInfections and Infestations: Respiratory infection.\nLaboratory Findings: In general, there were no clinically important influences of Blopress on routine laboratory variables. As for other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, small decreases in haemoglobin have been seen. Increases in creatinine, urea or potassium and decrease in sodium have been observed.\nIncreases in S-GPT were reported as adverse events slightly more often with Blopress than the placebo (1.3% vs 0.5%). No routine monitoring of laboratory variables is usually necessary for patients receiving Blopress. However, in patients with renal impairment, periodic monitoring of serum potassium and creatinine levels is recommended.\nTreatment of Heart Failure: The adverse experience profile of Blopress in heart failure patients was consistent with the pharmacology of the drug and the health status of the patients. Adverse reactions commonly (>1/100, <1/10) seen were: Vascular Disorders: Hypotension.\nMetabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Hyperkalaemia.\nRenal and Urinary Disorders: Renal impairment.\nLaboratory Findings: Increases in creatinine, urea and potassium. Periodic monitoring of serum creatinine and potassium is recommended.\nPost Marketing: The following adverse reactions have been reported very rarely (<1/10,000) in post marketing experiences: Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Leukopenia, neutropenia and agranulocytosis.\nMetabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia.\nNervous System Disorders: Dizziness, headache.\nGastrointestinal Disorders: Nausea.\nHepato-Biliary Disorders: Increased liver enzymes, abnormal hepatic function or hepatitis.\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioedema, rash, urticaria, pruritus.\nMusculoskeletal, Connective Tissue and Bone Disorders: Back pain, arthralgia, myalgia.\nRenal and Urinary Disorders: Renal impairment, including renal failure in susceptible patients.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "No drug interactions of clinical significance have been identified.\nCompounds which have been investigated in clinical pharmacokinetic studies include hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin, digoxin, oral contraceptives (i.e. ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel), glibenclamide, nifedipine and enalapril.\nCandesartan is eliminated only to a minor extent by hepatic metabolism (CYP2C9). Available interaction studies indicate no effect on CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 but the effect on other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes is presently unknown.\nThe antihypertensive effect of Blopress may be enhanced by other antihypertensives.\nBased on experiences with the use of other drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salts substitutes containing potassium, or other drugs that may increase potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increase in serum potassium.\nReversible increase in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with ACE inhibitors. A similar effect may occur with angiotensin II receptor antagonists and careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended during concomitant use.\nAs with other antihypertensive agents, the antihypertensive effect of candesartan may be attenuated by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as indomethacin.\nThe bioavailability of candesartan is not affected by food.",
      "pregnancy-safe": "Category D: There is positive evidence of human foetal risk, but the benefits from use in pregnant women may be acceptable despite the risk (e.g., if the drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or for a serious disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective).",

      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Angiotensin II is the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of hypertension, heart failure and other cardiovascular disorders. It is also has an important role in the pathogenesis of end organ hypertrophy and damage.\nThe major physiological effects of angiotensin II, such as vasoconstriction, aldosterone stimulation, regulation of salt and water homeostasis and stimulation of cell growth, are mediated via the type I (AT1) receptor.\nBlopress is a prodrug suitable for oral use. It is rapidly converted to the active drug, candesartan, by ester hydrolysis during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Blopress is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, selective for AT1 receptor, with tight binding to and slow dissociation from the receptor. It has no agonist activity.\nCandesartan does not inhibit ACE, which convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin. There is no effect on ACE and no potentiation of bradykinin or substance P. In controlled clinical trials comparing Blopress with ACE-inhibitor, the incidence of cough was lower in patients receiving Blopress. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\nHypertension: In hypertension, Blopress causes a dose-dependent, long lasting reduction in arterial blood pressure. The antihypertensive action is due to decreased systemic peripheral resistance, while heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output are not affected. There is no indication of serious exaggerate first-dose hypotension or rebound effect after cessation of treatment.\nBlopress is effective in all grades of hypertension.\nAfter administration of a single dose. Onset of antihypertensive effect generally occurs within 2 hours. With continuous treatment, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any dose generally attained within 4 weeks and is sustained during long-term treatment. It provides effective and smooth blood pressure reduction over the 24-hr with little difference between maximum and trough effects during the dosing interval.\nWhen Blopress is used together with hydrochlorothiazide, the reduction in blood pressure is additive. Blopress is similarly effective in patients irrespective of age and gender.\nBlopress increases renal blood flow and either has no effect on, or increases glomerular filtration rate while renal vascular resistance and filtration fraction are reduced. Blopress has no adverse effect on blood glucose or lipid profile.\nHeart Failure: Treatment with candesartan cilexetil reduces mortality, reduces hospitalization due to heart failure and improves symptoms in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction as shown in the Candesartan in Heart Failure - Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity (CHARM) programme.\nThis multinational, placebo controlled, double-blind study programme in chronic heart failure (Congestive heart failure) patients with NYHA functional class II to IV consisted of three separate studies: CHARM-Alternative (n=2,028) in patients with LVEF =40% not treated with an ACE inhibitor because of intolerance (mainly due to cough, 72%), CHARM-Added (n=2,548) in patients with LVEF =40% and treated with an ACE inhibitor, and CHARM-Preserved (n=3,023) in patients with LVEF >40%. Patients on optimal Congestive heart failure therapy at baseline were randomised to placebo or candesartan cilexetil (titrated from 4 mg or 8 mg once daily to 32 mg once daily or the highest tolerated dose, mean dose 24 mg) and followed for a median of 37.7 months. After 6 months of treatment, 63% of the patients still taking candesartan cilexetil (89%) were at the target dose of 32 mg.\nIn CHARM-Alternative, the composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality or first Congestive heart failure hospitalisation was significantly reduced with candesartan in comparison with placebo [hazard ratio (HR) 0.77, 95% CI 0.67-0.89, p <0.001]. This corresponds to a relative risk reduction of 23%. Fourteen patients needed to be treated for the duration of the study to prevent one patient from dying of a cardiovascular event or being hospitalised for treatment of heart failure. The composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or first Congestive heart failure hospitalisation was also significantly reduced with candesartan (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.92, p=0.001). Both the mortality and morbidity (Congestive heart failure hospitalisation) components of these composite endpoints contributed to the favourable effects of candesartan. Treatment with candesartan cilexetil resulted in improved NYHA functional class (p=0.008).\nIn CHARM-Added, the composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality or first Congestive heart failure hospitalisation was significantly reduced with candesartan in comparison with placebo (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75-0.96, p=0.011). This corresponds to a relative risk reduction of 15%. Twenty-three patients needed to be treated for the duration of the study to prevent one patient from dying of a cardiovascular event or being hospitalised for treatment of heart failure. The composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or first Congestive heart failure hospitalisation was also significantly reduced with candesartan (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78-0.98, p=0.021). Both the mortality and morbidity components of these composite endpoints contributed to the favourable effects of candesartan. Treatment with candesartan cilexetil resulted in improved NYHA functional class (p=0.020).\nIn CHARM-Preserved, no statistically significant reduction was achieved in the composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality or first Congestive heart failure hospitalisation (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77-1.03, p=0.118). The numerical reduction was attributable to reduced Congestive heart failure hospitalisation. There was no evidence of effect on mortality in this study.\nAll-cause mortality was not statistically significant when examined separately in each of the three CHARM studies. However, all-cause mortality was also assessed in pooled populations, CHARM-Alternative and CHARM-Added (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.98, p=0.018) and all three studies (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-1.00, p=0.055).\nThe beneficial effects of candesartan on cardiovascular mortality and Congestive heart failure hospitalization were consistent irrespective of age, gender and concomitant medication. Candesartan was effective also in patients taking both beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors at the same time, and the benefit was obtained whether or not patients were taking ACE inhibitors at the target dose recommended by treatment guidelines.\nIn patients with Congestive heart failure and depressed left ventricular systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF =40%), candesartan decreases systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, increases plasma renin activity and angiotensin II concentration, and decreases aldosterone levels.",

In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred than thiazides, so Blopress Plus is not recommended.\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment: Thiazide diuretics should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Therefore, care should be exercised with the dosing of Blopress Plus.",
      "over-dosage": "Symptoms: Based on pharmacological considerations, the main manifestation of an overdose of candesartan cilexetil is likely to be symptomatic hypotension and dizziness. In 2 case reports of overdose (candesartan cilexetil 160 and 432 mg), patient recovery was uneventful.\nThe main manifestation of an overdose of hydrochlorothiazide is acute loss of fluid and electrolytes. Symptoms eg, dizziness, hypotension, thirst, tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, sedation/impairment of consciousness and muscle cramps can also be observed.\nManagement: No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Blopress Plus. The following measures are, however, suggested in case of overdosage.\nWhen indicated, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage should be considered. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, symptomatic treatment should be instituted and vital signs monitored. The patient should be placed supine with the legs elevated. If it is not sufficient, plasma volume should be increased by infusion of isotonic saline solution. Serum electrolyte and acid balance should be checked and corrected, if needed. Sympathomimetic drugs may be administered if the previously mentioned measures are not sufficient.\nCandesartan cannot be removed by haemodialysis.

      "contra-indications": "Hypersensitivity to the active ingredients of Blopress Plus or sulfonamide-derived drugs (eg, hydrochlorothiazide) or to any of its excipients.\nPregnancy and lactation; severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 body surface area); severe hepatic impairment and or cholestasis; refractory hypokalemia and hypercalcemia; gout.\nWarnings Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality: Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and death when administered to pregnant women. Several dozen cases have been reported in the world literature in patients who were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Post-marketing experience has identified reports of fetal and neonatal toxicity in babies born to women treated with candesartan cilexetil during pregnancy.\nBecause candesartan cilexetil is a component of Blopress Plus, Blopress Plus should be discontinued as soon as possible when pregnancy is detected.\nThe use of drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy has been associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure and death.\nOligohydramnios in this setting has been associated with fetal limb contractures, craniofacial deformation and hypoplastic lung development.\nPrematurity, intrauterine growth retardation and patent ductus arteriosus have also been reported, although it is not clear whether these occurrences were due to exposure to the drug.\nThese adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine drug exposure that has been limited to the 1st trimester. Mothers whose embryos and foetuses are exposed to an angiotensin II receptor antagonist only during the 1st trimester should be so informed. Nonetheless, when patients become pregnant, physicians should have the patient discontinue the use of Blopress Plus as soon as possible.\nRarely (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies), no alternative to a drug acting on the renin-angiotensin system will be found. In these rare cases, the mothers should be apprised of the potential hazards to their foetuses, and serial ultrasound examinations should be performed to assess the intra-amniotic environment.\nIf oligohydramnios is observed, Blopress Plus should be discontinued unless it is considered life saving for the mother.\nContraction stress testing (CST), a nonstress test (NST), or biophysical profiling (Blood PressureP) may be appropriate, depending upon the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the foetus has sustained irreversible injury.\nInfants with histories of in utero exposure to an angiotensin II receptor antagonist should be closely observed for hypotension, oliguria and hyperkalemia. If oliguria occurs, attention should be directed toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion.\nExchange transfusion or dialysis may be required as means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function.\nCandesartan Cilexetil-Hydrochlorothiazide: There was no evidence of teratogenicity or other adverse effects on embryo-fetal development when pregnant mice, rats or rabbits were treated orally with candesartan cilexetil alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.\nFor mice, the maximum dose of candesartan cilexetil was 1000 mg/kg/day [about 150 times the maximum recommended daily human dose (MRHD)].\nFor rats, the maximum dose of candesartan cilexetil was 100 mg/kg/day (about 31 times the MRHD).\nFor rabbits, the maximum dose of candesartan cilexetil was 1 mg/kg/day (a maternally toxic dose that is about half the MRHD).\nIn each of these studies, hydrochlorothiazide was tested at the same dose level (10 mg/kg/day, about 4, 8 and 15 times the MRHD in mice, rats and rabbits, respectively). There was no evidence of harm to the rat or mouse foetus, or embryo in studies in which hydrochlorothiazide was administered alone to the pregnant rat or mouse at doses of up to 1000 and 3000 mg/kg/day, respectively.\nThiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. There is risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults.\nHypotension in Volume- and Salt-Depleted Patients: Based on adverse events reported from all clinical trials of Blopress Plus, excessive reduction of blood pressure was rarely seen in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide (0.4%). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy may cause symptomatic hypotension in patients with intravascular volume or sodium depletion eg, in patients treated vigorously with diuretics or in patients on dialysis. These conditions should be corrected prior to administration of Blopress Plus, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision.\nIf hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an IV infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.\nHydrochlorothiazide: Impaired Hepatic Function: Thiazide diuretics should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.\nHypersensitivity Reaction: Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history.\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus: Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus.\nLithium Interaction: Lithium generally should not be given with thiazides.\nUse in lactation: It is not known whether candesartan is secreted in human milk, but candesartan has been shown to be present in rat milk. Thiazides appear in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
      "special-precautions": "General: Candesartan Cilexetil-Hydrochlorothiazide: In clinical trials of various doses of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum 3.5 mEq/L) was 2.5% vs 2.1% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L) was 0.4% vs 1% for placebo. No patient receiving Blopress Plus 16-12.5 mg was discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. Overall, the combination of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide had no clinically significant effect on serum potassium.\nHydrochlorothiazide: Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.\nAll patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance eg, hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis and hypokalemia.\nSerum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, irrespective of cause, include dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, seizures, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia and gastrointestinal disturbances eg, nausea and vomiting.\nHypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy. Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia may cause cardiac arrhythmia and may also sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (eg, increased ventricular irritability).\nAlthough any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease), chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis.\nDilution hyponatraemia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salts, except in rare instances when the hyponatraemia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.\nHyperuricaemia may occur or acute gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.\nIn diabetic patients, dosage adjustment of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics. Thus, latent diabetes mellitus may be manifested during thiazide therapy.\nThe antihypertensive effect of hydrochlorothiazide may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient.\nIf progressive renal impairment becomes evident, consider with holding or discontinuing diuretic therapy.\nThiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium which may result in hypomagnesemia.\nThiazides have been shown to decrease the urinary calcium excretion or may impair glucose tolerance.\nThiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.\nIncreases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy.\nImpaired Renal Function: Candesartan Cilexetil: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with candesartan cilexetil. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (eg, patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonist has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely, with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been reported. There has been no long-term use of candesartan cilexetil in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but similar results may be expected. Renal function may worsen in patients with renal artery stenosis.\nHydrochlorothiazide: Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function.\nAnaesthesia and Surgery: Hypotension may occur during anaesthesia and surgery in patients treated with angiotensin II antagonists due to blockade of the RAA system. Very rarely, hypotension may be severe such that it may warrant the use of IV fluids and/or vasopressors.\nUse in children: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.",
      "adverse-reactions": "Candesartan Cilexetil-Hydrochlorothiazide: Blopress Plus has been evaluated for safety in >2800 patients treated for hypertension. More than 750 of these patients were studied for at least 6 months and >500 patients were treated for at least 1 year. Adverse experiences have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. The overall incidence of adverse events reported with Blopress Plus was comparable to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse experiences was not related to dose, age, gender or race.\nIn placebo-controlled trials that included 1089 patients treated with various combinations of candesartan cilexetil (doses of 2-32 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (doses of 6.25-25 mg) and 592 patients treated with placebo, adverse events, whether or not attributed to treatment, occurring in >2% of patients treated with Blopress Plus and that were more frequent for Blopress Plus than placebo were: Respiratory System Disorder: Upper respiratory tract infections (3.6% vs 3%).\nBody as a Whole: Back pain (3.3% vs 2.4%), influenza-like symptoms (2.5% vs 1.9%).\nCentral/Peripheral Nervous System: Dizziness (2.9% vs 1.2%).\nThe frequency of headache was >2% [2.9% in patients treated with Blopress Plus but was less frequent than the rate in patients treated with placebo (5.2%)].\nOther adverse events have been reported whether or not attributed to treatment, with an incidence of =0.5% from >2800 patients worldwide treated with Blopress Plus included: Body as a Whole: Inflicted injury, fatigue, pain, peripheral oedema, asthenia.\nCentral and Peripheral Nervous System: Vertigo, paresthesia, hypesthesia.\nRespiratory System Disorders: Bronchitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis, coughing, rhinitis, dyspnea.\nMusculoskeletal System Disorders: Arthralgia, myalgia, arthrosis, arthritis, leg cramps, sciatica.\nGastrointestinal System Disorders: Nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, gastritis, gastroenteritis, vomiting.\nMetabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hyperuricaemia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, increased BUN, increased creatinine phosphokinase.\nUrinary System Disorder: Urinary tract infection, hematuria, cystitis.\nLiver/Biliary System Disorders: Abnormal hepatic function, increased transaminase levels.\nHeart Rate and Rhythm Disorders: Tachycardia, palpitation, extrasystoles, bradycardia.\nPsychiatric Disorders: Depression, insomnia, anxiety.\nCardiovascular Disorders: Abnormal ECG.\nSkin and Appendages Disorders: Eczema, increased sweating, pruritus, dermatitis, rash.\nPlatelet/Blood Clotting Disorders: Epistaxis.\nResistance Mechanism Disorders: Infection, viral infection.\nVision Disorder: Conjunctivitis.\nHearing and Vestibular Disorders: Tinnitus.\nReported events seen less frequently than 0.5% included angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and angioedema.\nCandesartan Cilexetil: Other adverse experiences that have been reported without regard to causality are as follows: Body as a Whole: Fever.\nMetabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Hypertriglyceridemia.\nPsychiatric Disorders: Somnolence.\nUrinary System Disorders: Albuminuria.\nHydrochlorothiazide: Other adverse experiences that have been reported without regard to causality are as follows: Body as a Whole: Weakness.\nCardiovascular: Hypotension including orthostatic hypotension (may be aggravated by alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics or antihypertensive drugs).\nDigestive: Pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), sialadenitis, cramping, constipation, gastric, irritation, anorexia.\nHematologic: Aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia.\nHypersensitivity: Anaphylactic reactions, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis and cutaneous vasculitis), respiratory distress including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, photosensitivity, urticaria, purpura.\nMetabolic: Electrolyte imbalance, glycosuria.\nMusculoskeletal: Muscle spasm.\nNervous System/Psychiatric: Restlessness.\nRenal: Renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis.\nSkin: Erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis, alopecia.\nSpecial Senses: Transient blurred vision, xanthopsia.\nUrogenital: Impotence.\nLaboratory Test Finding: In controlled clinical trials, clinically important changes in standard laboratory parameter were rarely associated with the administration of Blopress Plus.\nCreatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine was observed infrequently. One patient discontinued Blopress Plus due to increased BUN. No patient discontinued due to an increase in serum creatinine.\nHemoglobin and Hematocrit: Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.2 g/dL and 0.4% volume, respectively) were observed in patients treated with Blopress Plus, but were rarely of clinical importance.\nPotassium: A small decrease (mean decrease of 0.1 mEq/L) was observed in patients treated with Blopress Plus. In placebo-controlled trials, hypokalemia was reported in 0.4% of patients treated with Blopress Plus as compared to 1% of patients treated with hydrochlorothiazide or 0.2% of patients treated with placebo.\nLiver Function Tests: Occasional elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "Candesartan Cilexetil: No significant drug interactions have been reported in studies of candesartan cilexetil given with other drugs eg, glyburide, nifedipine, digoxin, warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide and oral contraceptives in healthy volunteers. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 system, and at therapeutic concentrations has no effects on P-450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit, or rarely metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected.\nHydrochlorothiazide: When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, barbiturates or narcotics. Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.\nAntidiabetic Drugs (Oral Agent and Insulin): Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.\nOther Antihypertensive Drugs: Additive effect or potentiation.\nCholestyramine and Colestipol Resins: Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively.\nCorticosteroids: ACTH-intensified electrolyte depletion, particularly hypokalemia.\nPressor Amines (eg, Norepinephrine): Possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use.\nNondepolarizing Skeletal Muscle Relaxants (eg, Tubocurarine): Possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant.\nLithium: Generally should not be given with diuretic agents because the renal clearance of lithium is reduced and a high risk of lithium toxicity is added. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparation before use of such preparations with Blopress Plus.\nNonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: In some patients, the administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics.\nTherefore, when Blopress Plus and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of diuretic is obtained.",

      "description": "Each tablet contains candesartan cilexetil 16 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg.",
      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Blopress Plus contains candesartan cilexetil, an angiotensin II antagonist and hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic.\nAngiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.\nThere is also an AT2 receptor found in many tissues, but AT2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (>10,000-fold) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.\nBlockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitor, which inhibits the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalysed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response of bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevancies not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors, or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.\nBlockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure.\nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanism's electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, therefore co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.\nThe mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of thiazides is unknown.",

An initial loading dose up to 1.5 µg/kg bw (0.003 ml/kg bw) can be given over 10 minutes.\nSubcutaneous Injection: Adults: 1-2 mg (2-4) ml) is given during a 24 hour interval, split into at least 4 occasions.\nChildren: Up to 25 µg/kg bw (0.05 ml/kg bw) is given during a 24 hour interval, split into at least 4 occasions.\nRespules: Inhaled bronchodilators should, as initial therapy, be used as required rather than regularly.\nBRICASMA solution for nebulization is to be used in nebulizers with or without assisted breathing in acute or subacute disorders where conventional inhalers prove unsatisfactory and in maintenance therapy in severe broncho-obstructive conditions.\nDosage should be individual.\nBody Weight >25 kg: 5 mg (1 single dose unit, 2 ml) is inhaled 2 up to 4 times in a 24 h period.\nTerbuhaler: Dosage of inhaled terbutaline via BRICASMA TURBUHALER should be individualized.\nBRICASMA TURBUHALER should, as initially therapy, be used as required rather than regularly.\nAdult and children over 12 years: 0.25 mg-0.50 mg as required or, when used as regular maintenance therapy, every 6 hours. In severe cases the single dose may be increased to 1.5 mg. The total dose in 24 hours should not exceed 2 mg.\nChildren 7-12 years: 0.25 mg-0.5 mg as required or, when used as regular maintenance therapy, every 6 hours. In severe cases the single dose may be increased to 1.0 mg. The total dose in 24 hours should not exceed 2 mg.\nThe medication from BRICASMA TURBUHALER is delivered to the lung as patient inhales and therefore it is important to instruct the patient to breathe in forcefully and deeply through the mouthpiece. When prescribing BRICASMA TURBUHALER to young children it is necessary to ascertain that they can follow the instructions for use.\nThe patient may not taste or feel any medication when using BRICASMA TURBUHALER due to the small amount of drug dispensed.\nAdministration: Injection: The dose may be given intravenously or subcutaneously. BRICASMA for injection, 1 ml ampoule, is intended for subcutaneous and intravenous injection. Dosage should be individual.\nTerbuhaler: Instruction for correct use of TURBUHALER.\nTURBUHALER is inspiratory flow-driven which means that, when the patient inhales through the mouthpiece, the substance will follow the inspired air into the airways.\nNOTE: It is important to instruct the patient: To breathe in forcefully and deeply through the mouthpiece to ensure that an optimal dose is delivered to the lungs; never to breathe out through the mouthpiece.\nThe patient may not taste or feel any medication when using TURBUHALER due to the small amount of drug dispensed.\nFor detailed instructions, see Caution for Usage.",
      "over-dosage": "Too frequent administration, as with other sympathomimetic agents, may cause nausea, headaches, changes in blood pressure, anxiety, tension, insomnia, tremor. The symptoms and sign are those characteristic of excessive sympathetic stimulation.\nSymptoms: Headache, anxiety, tremor, nausea, tonic muscle cramps, palpitation, tachycardia and cardiac arrhythmia. A fall in blood pressure sometimes occurs.\nLaboratory Findings: Hyperglycaemia and lactacidosis sometimes occur. ß2-agonists may cause hypokalemia as a result of redistribution of potassium.\nTreatment: Usually no treatment is required.\nIf it can be suspected that significant amounts of terbutaline sulphate have been swallowed, the following measures should be considered: Gastric lavage, activated charcoal. Determine acid-base balance, blood sugar and electrolytes. Monitor heart rate and rhythm and blood pressure. Metabolic changes should be corrected. A cardio-selective ß-blocker (e.g. metoprolol) is recommended for the treatment of arrhythmias causing a hemodynamic deterioration. The ß-blocker should be used with care because of the possibility of inducing bronchial obstruction.\nIf the ß2-mediated reduction in peripheral vascular resistance significantly contributes to the fall in blood pressure, a volume expander should be given.\nMild and Moderate Cases: Reduce the dose. Then increase the dose more slowly if the broncholytic effect is insufficient.\nTurbuhaler: There is a potential for progressive accumulation of dry powder in the mouthpiece of the Bricasma Turbuhaler that could be released if dropped (for example, see table) towards the end of inhaler life. To minimize unnecessary systemic exposure to terbutaline, the patients should be advised to, when possible, rinse their mouth after each use.",

      "special-precautions": "If a previously effective dosage regimen no longer gives the same symptomatic relief, the patient should seek medical care as soon as possible as this could be sign of worsening asthma and repeated inhalations of ß2-agonists must then not delay reassessment of the asthma therapy.\nAs for all ß2-agonists, caution should be observed in patients with thyrotoxicosis. Cardiovascular effects may be seen with sympathomimetic drugs, including Bricasma. There is some evidence from post-marketing data and published literature of myocardial ischaemia associated with ß-agonists.\nPatients with underlying severe heart disease (e.g. ischaemic heart disease, arrhythmia or severe heart failure) who are receiving Bricasma should be warned to seek medical advice if they experience chest pain or other symptoms of worsening heart disease. Attention should be paid to assessment of symptoms eg, dyspnoea and chest pain, as they may be of either respiratory or cardiac origin.\nDue to the hyperglycemic effect of ß2-agonist, additional blood glucose controls are recommended initially in diabetic patients.\nDue to the positive inotropic effect of ß2-agonist these drugs should not be used in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\nAs terbutaline sulphate is largely excreted in urine, caution should be exercised in patients with renal impairment.\nIncreased tendency to uterine bleeding has been reported in connection with Caesarean section. However, this can be effectively stopped by propranolol 1-2 mg injected intravenously.\nTerbutaline is not indicated and should not be used for the management of preterm labor. Serious adverse reactions have been reported following administration of terbutaline sulphate to women in labor.\nThese reports have included transient hypokalemia, pulmonary edema (sometimes after delivery) and hypoglycemia in the mother and/or neonatal child. Maternal death has been reported with terbutaline sulphate and other drugs of this class.\nThere have been rare reports of seizures occurring in patients receiving terbutaline, which do not recur when the drug is discontinued and have not been explained on any other basis.\nTerbutaline sulphate is a sympathomimetic amine and such should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders (including arrhythmias, coronary insufficiency and hypertension), in patients with hyperthyroidism or diabetes mellitus, history of seizures, or in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines.\nPotentially serious hypokalemia may result from ß2-agonist therapy. Particular caution is recommended in acute severe asthma as the associated risk may be augmented by hypoxia. The hypokalemic effect may be potentiated by concomitant treatment (see Interactions). It is recommended that serum potassium levels are monitored in such situations. Patients susceptible to hypokalemia should be monitored because transient early falls in serum potassium levels have been reported with ß-agonist.\nImmediate hypersensitivity reactions and exacerbation of bronchospasm have been reported after terbutaline administration.\nLactic acidosis has been reported in association with high therapeutic doses of parenteral and nebulised short-acting beta-agonist therapy, mainly in patients being treated for an acute asthma exacerbation (see Overdosage and Adverse Reactions). In patients not adequately responding to acute Bricasma therapy, consideration should be given to the presence of lactic acidosis as a possible contributing factor to ongoing respiratory symptoms.\nTablet: Terbutaline should not be given together with non-selective ß-blocker.\nRespules: The patient's inhalation technique should be checked regularly, and the optimal dose of Bricasma should be adjusted for each nebulizer.\nTurbuhaler: Additional blood glucose tests are recommended for asthmatic patient with concomitant diabetes starting on Bricasma turbuhaler therapy, due to the risk of hyperglycaemia with ß2-agonist. ß2 stimulants have successfully been used in the acute treatment of severe ischemic heart failure.\nDue to the positive inotropic effect of ß2-agonists, these drugs should not be used with hypertrophic cardiomyopathia.\nHowever, these drugs have an arrhythmogenic potential which must be considered in the treatment of individual lung patient.\nEffects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines: BRICASMA does not affect the ability to drive or use machines.\nUse in Children: Safety and effectiveness in children <12 years have not been established.\nUse In Pregnancy and Lactation No teratogenic effects have been observed in patients or in animals. However, caution is recommended during the 1st trimester of pregnancy.\nTerbutaline is excreted in breast milk but an influence on the child is unlikely with therapeutic doses. Caution should be exercised when Bricasma is administered to a nursing woman.\nTransient hypoglycemia has been reported in newborn preterm infants after maternal ß2-agonist treatment.",
      "adverse-reactions": "The intensity of the adverse reactions depends on dosage and route of administration. An initial dose titration will often reduce the adverse reactions.

Drugs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.\nCaution For Usage Turbuhaler: Instructions for Use, Handling and Disposal: Turbuhaler is a multidose inhaler from which very small amounts of powder are administered. When the patient breathe in through turbuhaler, the powder is delivered to the lungs. It is therefore important that the patient inhale forcefully and deeply through the mouthpiece.\nHow to Prepare a New Inhaler to Use: Before using turbuhaler for the 1st time, the patient need to prepare the inhaler for use.\n1. Unscrew and lift off the cover.\n2. Hold the inhaler upright with the red grip downwards. Do not hold the mouthpiece when turning the grip. Turn the grip as far as it will go in 1 direction and then back again in the opposite direction as far as it will go. It does not matter which way to turn first. During this procedure, a click will be heard.\nThe inhaler is now ready for use and this procedure should not be repeated again.\nHow to Use Bricasma Turbuhaler: To administer 1 dose, simply follow the instructions as follows.\n1. Unscrew and lift off the cover.\n2. Hold the inhaler upright with the red grip downwards. Do not hold the mouthpiece when turning the grip. To load the inhaler with a dose turn the grip as far as it will go in 1 direction, and then back again in the opposite direction as far as it will go. It does not matter which way to turn first. During this procedure, a click will be heard.\n3. Hold the inhaler away from the mouth. Breathe out. Do not breathe out through the mouthpiece.\n4. Place the mouthpiece gently between the teeth, close lips and inhale forcefully and deeply through the mouth. Do not chew or bite on the mouthpiece.\n5. Remove the inhaler from the mouth, before breathing out.\n6. If greater than one dose has been prescribed, repeat steps 2-5.\n7. Replace the cover by screwing it back on tightly.\n8. Rinse mouth out with water after inhaling prescribed dose.\nNote: Never breathe out through the mouthpiece. Always replace the cover properly after use.\nAs the amount of the powder dispensed is very small, the patient may not be able to taste it after inhalation. However, the patient can still be confident that the dose has been inhaled if the instructions have been followed.\nCleaning: Clean the outside of the mouthpiece regularly (weekly) with a dry tissue. Do not use water for cleaning the mouthpiece.\nDose Indicator: When a red mark is first seen in the indicator window, there are approximately 20 doses left. When the red mark has reached the lower edge of the window the inhaler will no longer deliver the correct amount of medicine and should be discarded. The sound heard if the inhaler is shaken, is not produced by the medication but by a drying agent.\nDisposal: Always be sure to dispose of used turbuhaler responsibly in the recommended way, since some of the medicine will remain inside it. Ask a pharmacist for advice.\nIncompatibilities: BRICASMA solution for nebulization should not be mixed with alkaline solution i.e. solution with a pH higher than 7.0.",

      "mechanism": "Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Selective ß2-agonist, terbutaline. ATC Code: R03C C03.\nPharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: Terbutaline is a sympathomimetic bronchodilator with a degree of selective ß2-stimulant activity on the respiratory system.\nTerbutaline is an adrenergic agonist which predominantly stimulates ß2-receptors, thus, producing relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, inhibition of the release of endogenous spasmogens, inhibition of edema caused by endogenous mediators and increased mucociliary clearance.\nInjection: After SC injection of terbutaline the duration of onset regarding the bronchodilating effect is <5 minutes. Maximum effect is reached within 30 minutes.\nRespules: Inhaled terbutaline acts within a few min and has a duration for up to 6 hours. Bricasma respules is to be used in nebulizers with or without assisted breathing in acute or subacute disorders where conventional inhalers prove unsatisfactory, and in maintenance therapy in severe broncho-obstructive condition.\nBricasma respules is ready for use without dilution. Bricasma respules is isotonic and contains no preservatives.\nTurbuhaler: Inhaled terbutaline acts within a few min and has a duration for up to 6 hours.\nAbout 10% of the dose is deposited in the lungs. Terbutaline is metabolized mainly by conjugation with the sulphuric acid and excreted as the sulphate conjugate. No active metabolites are formed. BRICASMA TURBUHALER contains pure terbutaline sulphate and is free from propellants lubricants, preservatives, carrier substances or other additives.\nBRICASMA TURBUHALER is breath actuated and hence, there is no need to coordinate the release of the dose and the inhalation as with a pressurized inhaler. When inhaling, the substance follows the inspired air into the airways.\nPharmacokinetics: Terbutaline is metabolized mainly by conjugation with the sulphuric acid and excreted as the sulphate conjugate. No active metabolites are formed.\nInjection: The plasma half-life is about 16 hours. After IV and SC administration of terbutaline 90% is excreted renally during 48-96 hours. Of this, about 60% consists of unmetabolized terbutaline.\nTurbuhaler: About 20-30% of the metered dose is deposited in the lungs at a normal inhalation flow rate.\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: Ampoule: The major toxic effect of terbutaline, observed in toxicological studies, is focal myocardial necrosis. This type of cardiotoxicity is a well-known class effect and the effect of terbutaline is similar to or less pronounced than that of other ß-receptor agonists. Terbutaline has been used extensively over many years for the relief of bronchospasm without identifying any areas of concern.",

      "contra-indications": "Hypersensitivity (eg, angioedema) to ticagrelor or to any of the components of Brilinta (see Adverse Reactions).\nHistory of Intracranial Hemorrhage: Patients with a history of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) because of a high risk of recurrent ICH in this population (see Pharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: Clinical Studies under Actions).\nActive Bleeding: Patients with active pathological bleeding eg, peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage (see Warnings, Precautions and Adverse Reactions).\nSevere Hepatic Impairment: Patients with severe hepatic impairment because of a probable increase in exposure and it has not been studied in these patients. Severe hepatic impairment increases the risk of bleeding because of reduced synthesis of coagulation proteins (see Pharmacology under Actions).\nWarnings Bleeding Risk: Brilinta, like other antiplatelet agents, can cause significant, sometimes fatal, bleeding.\nDo not use Brilinta in patients with active pathological bleeding or a history of intracranial hemorrhage.\nDo not start Brilinta in patients planned to undergo urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). When possible, discontinue Brilinta at least 5 days prior to any surgery.\nSuspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), CABG or other surgical procedures in the setting of Brilinta.\nIf possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing Brilinta. Stopping Brilinta increases the risk of subsequent CV events.\nAspirin Dose and Brilinta Effectiveness: Maintenance doses of aspirin >100 mg reduce the effectiveness of Brilinta and should be avoided. After any initial dose, use with aspirin 75-100 mg/day.",
      "special-precautions": "General Risk of Bleeding: Drugs that inhibit platelet function including Brilinta increase the risk of bleeding. Brilinta increased the overall risk of bleeding (major + minor) to a somewhat greater extent than did clopidogrel. The increase was seen for non-CABG-related bleeding, but not for CABG-related bleeding. Fatal and life-threatening bleeding rates were not increased (see Adverse Reactions).\nIn general, risk factors for bleeding include older age, a history of bleeding disorders, performance of percutaneous invasive procedures and concomitant use of medications that increase the risk of bleeding [eg, anticoagulant and fibrinolytic therapy, higher doses of aspirin, and chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)].\nWhen possible, discontinue Brilinta five days prior to surgery. Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, or other surgical procedures, even if the patient does not have any signs of bleeding.\nIf possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing Brilinta. Stopping Brilinta increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events (see Precautions and Adverse Reactions).\nConcomitant Aspirin Maintenance Dose: In PLATO, use of BRILINTA with maintenance doses of aspirin >100 mg decreased the effectiveness of Brilinta. Therefore, after the initial loading dose of aspirin (usually 325 mg), use Brilinta with a maintenance dose of aspirin 75-100 mg (see Pharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: Clinical Studies under Actions, and Dosage and Administration).\nModerate Hepatic Impairment: BRILINTA has not been studied in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment, noting the probable increase in exposure to ticagrelor.\nDyspnea: Dyspnea was reported in 14% of patients treated with BRILINTA and in 8% of patients taking clopidogrel. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea during treatment with BRILINTA, exclude underlying diseases that may require treatment. If dyspnea is determined to be related to BRILINTA, no specific treatment is required; continue BRILINTA without interruption.\nIn a substudy, 199 patients from PLATO underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no significant difference between treatment groups for FEV1. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after 1 month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment.\nDiscontinuation of BRILINTA: Avoid interruption of BRILINTA treatment. If BRILINTA must be temporarily discontinued (eg, to treat bleeding or for elective surgery), restart it as soon as possible. Discontinuation of BRILINTA will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis and death.\nStrong Inhibitors of Cytochrome CYP3A: Ticagrelor is metabolized by CYP3A4/5. Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors eg, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and voriconazole (see Pharmacology under Actions and Interactions).\nCytochrome CYP3A Potent Inducers: Avoid use with potent CYP3A inducers eg, rifampin, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (see Pharmacology under Actions and Interactions).\nHepatic Impairment: BRILINTA has not been studied in the patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Ticagrelor is metabolized by the liver and impaired hepatic function can increase risks for bleeding and other adverse events. Hence, BRILINTA is contraindicated for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment and its use should be considered carefully in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment (see Pharmacology under Actions, Contraindications and Precautions).\nRenal Impairment: No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment. Patients receiving dialysis have not been studied (see Pharmacology under Actions).\nUse in Children: The safety and effectiveness of Brilinta in pediatric patients have not been established.\nUse in Elderly: In PLATO, 43% of patients were =65 years and 15% were =75 years. The relative risk of bleeding was similar in both treatment and age groups.\nNo overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients. While this clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\nUse In Pregnancy and Lactation Use in Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of BRILINTA use in pregnant women. In animal studies, ticagrelor caused structural abnormalities at maternal doses about 5-7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. BRILINTA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\nIn reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20-300 mg/kg/day. The lowest dose was approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m2 basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21-63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred.\nIn a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10-180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). Relatively minor effects eg, delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately ½ and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis).\nUse in Lactation: It is not known whether ticagrelor or its active metabolites are excreted in human milk. Ticagrelor is excreted in rat milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from BRILINTA, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
      "adverse-reactions": "Clinical Trials Experience: The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Dyspnea (see Precautions).\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nBRILINTA has been evaluated for safety in more than 10,000 patients, including more than 3,000 patients treated for >1 year.\nBleeding: PLATO used the following bleeding severity categorization: Major Bleed: Fatal/Life-Threatening: Any one of the following: Fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial bleed with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension due to bleeding and requiring pressors or surgery; clinically overt or apparent bleeding associated with a decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) of more than 5 g/dL; transfusion of 4 or more units [whole blood or packed red blood cells (PRBCs)] for bleeding.\nMajor Bleed: Other: Any one of the following: Significantly disabling (eg, intraocular with permanent vision loss); clinically overt or apparent bleeding associated with a decrease in Hb of 3 g/dL; transfusion of 2-3 units (whole blood or PRBCs) for bleeding.\nMinor Bleed: Requires medical intervention to stop or treat bleeding (eg, epistaxis requiring visit to medical facility for packing).\nMinimal Bleed: All others (eg, bruising, bleeding gums, oozing from injection sites, etc) not requiring intervention or treatment.\nFigure 9 shows major bleeding events over time. Many events are early, at a time of coronary angiography, PCI, CABG and other procedures, but the risk persists during later use of antiplatelet therapy.\nAnnualized rates of bleeding are summarized in Table 2. About half of the bleeding events were in the first 30 days. (See Table 2.)\nAs shown in Table 2, BRILINTA was associated with a somewhat greater risk of non-CABG bleeding than was clopidogrel. No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with BRILINTA compared to clopidogrel.\nIn PLATO, 1,584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Table 3. Rates were very high but similar for BRILINTA and clopidogrel. (See Table 3.)\nAlthough the platelet inhibition effect of Brilinta has a faster offset than clopidogrel in in vitro tests and Brilinta is a reversibly binding P2Y12 inhibitor, PLATO did not show an advantage of BRILINTA compared to clopidogrel for CABG-related bleeding. When antiplatelet therapy was stopped 5 days before CABG, major bleeding occurred in 75% of BRILINTA treated patients and 79% on clopidogrel.\nNo data exists with Brilinta regarding a hemostatic benefit of platelet transfusions.\nDrug Discontinuation: In PLATO, the rate of study drug discontinuation attributed to adverse reactions was 7.4% for BRILINTA and 5.4% for clopidogrel. Bleeding caused permanent discontinuation of study drug in 2.3% of BRILINTA patients and 1.0% of clopidogrel patients. Dyspnea led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% of BRILINTA and 0.1% of clopidogrel patients.\nCommon Adverse Events: A variety of non-hemorrhagic adverse events occurred in PLATO at rates of =3%. These are shown in Table 4. In the absence of a placebo control, whether these are drug related cannot be determined in most cases, except where they are more common on BRILINTA or clearly related to the drug's pharmacologic effect (dyspnea). (See Table 4.)\nPost-Marketing Experience: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of BRILINTA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\nImmune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema (see Contraindications).\nBradycardia: In clinical studies BRILINTA has been shown to increase the occurrence of Holterdetected bradyarrhythmias (including ventricular pauses). PLATO excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (eg, patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2nd or 3rd degree Atrioventricular block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). In PLATO, syncope, pre-syncope and loss of consciousness were reported by 1.7% and 1.5% of BRILINTA and clopidogrel patients, respectively.\nIn a Holter substudy of about 3,000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with BRILINTA (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6% respectively after 1 month.\nGynecomastia: In PLATO, gynecomastia was reported by 0.23% of men on BRILINTA and 0.05% on clopidogrel.\nOther sex-hormonal adverse reactions, including sex organ malignancies, did not differ between the 2 treatment groups in PLATO.\nLab Abnormalities: Serum Uric Acid: Serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on BRILINTA and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel in PLATO. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group).\nSerum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving BRILINTA compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events eg, acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy or oliguria.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "Effects of Other Drugs: Ticagrelor is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5.

      "description": "Each BRILINTA tablet contains ticagrelor 90 mg.\nBRILINTA contais ticagrelor, a cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidine, inhibitor of platelet activation and aggregation mediated by the P2Y12 ADP-receptor. Chemically, it is (1S,2S,3R,5S)-3-[7-{[(1R,2S)-2-(3,4-difluorophenyl)cyclopropyl]amino}-5(propylthio)-3H-[1,2,3]-triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidin-3-yl]-5-(2hydroxyethoxy)cyclopentane-1,2-diol. The empirical formula of ticagrelor is C23H28F2N6O4S and its molecular weight is 522.57.\nTicagrelor is a crystalline powder with an aqueous solubility of approximately 10 mcg/mL at room temperature.\nExcipients/Inactive Ingredients: Core: Mannitol (E421), dibasic calcium phosphate, magnesium steareate, sodium starch glycolate, hydroxypropyl cellulose.\nCoating: Talc, titanium dioxide (E171), yellow ferric oxide, polyethylene glycol 400 and hypromellose.",
      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Mechanism of Action: Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent.\nPharmacodynamics: The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6 week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) 20 micromolar as the platelet aggregation agonist.\nThe onset of IPA was evaluated on day 1 of the study following loading doses of ticagrelor 180 mg or clopidogrel 600 mg. As shown in Figure 1, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hrs and was maintained for at least 8 hrs.\nThe offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to ADP 20 micromolar.\nAs shown in Figure 2, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in figure 2 shows that after 24 hrs, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel. (See Figures 1 and 2.)\nTransitioning from clopidogrel to BRILINTA resulted in an absolute IPA increase of 26.4% and from BRILINTA to clopidogrel resulted in an absolute IPA decrease of 24.5%. Patients can be transitioned from clopidogrel to BRILINTA without interruption of antiplatelet effect (see Dosage and Administration).\nClinical Studies: The clinical evidence for the effectiveness of BRILINTA is derived from PLATO, a randomized double-blind study comparing BRILINTA (N=9,333) to clopidogrel (N=9,291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. Study endpoints were obtained until the study was complete, even if drug was discontinued.\nPatients who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms were randomized to receive BRILINTA or clopidogrel. Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. Subjects in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if previous clopidogrel therapy had not been given prior to randomization. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional clopidogrel 300 mg at investigator discretion. All subjects randomized to BRILINTA received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Concomitant aspirin was recommended at a loading dose of 160-500 mg. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75-100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment.\nBecause of ticagrelor's metabolism by CYP3A enzymes, the protocol recommended limiting the maximum dosage of simvastatin and lovastatin to 40 mg in both study arms. Because of an increased bleeding risk, the study excluded patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, a gastrointestinal bleed within the past 6 months, or other factors that predispose to bleeding.\nPLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were >65 years and 15% were >75 years.\nThe study's primary endpoint was the composite of 1st occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. The components were assessed as secondary endpoints.\nMedian exposure to study drug was 277 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO.\nTable 1 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality. (See Table 1.)\nThe difference between treatments on the composite resulted from effects on CV death and MI; each was statistically significant when considered as a secondary endpoint and there was no beneficial effect on strokes. For all-cause mortality the benefit was also statistically significant (p=0.0003) with a hazard ratio of 0.78.\nAmong 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated \"definite\") than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91; p=0.0091). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents.\nThe Kaplan-Meier curve (Figure 3) shows time to 1st occurrence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke in the overall study. (See Figure 3.)\nThe curves separate by 30 days (RRR 12%) and continue to diverge throughout the 12-month treatment period (RRR 16%).\nA wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Many of these are shown in Figure 4. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are 2 marked exceptions: A finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further as follows.\nMost of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (eg, final diagnosis, aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). Patients were not stratified by initial diagnosis, but the effect in the unstable angina subset (determined after randomization) appeared smaller than the effect in the non-ST elevation myocardial infarction NSTEMI and STEMI subsets. The results in the subsets based on final diagnosis (STEMI, NSTEMI and unstable angina) are also presented in Figure 4. (See Figure 4.)\nRegional Differences: Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (US and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the US subset. The statistical test for the US/non-US comparison is statistically significant (p=0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal p-values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable.\nA wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the US and non-US (including intended invasive vs planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome.\nAspirin Dose: The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were very different in the US and elsewhere, with about 8% of non-US investigators using aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% using doses above 300 mg, in contrast with US practice, where 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored BRILINTA when used with low maintenance doses (=100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the US and elsewhere. Figure 4 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 5 shows results by region and dose. (See Figure 5.)\nLike any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the 2 major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and nonfatal MI.\nDespite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of BRILINTA.\nPharmacogenetics: In a genetic substudy of PLATO (n=10,285), the effects of Brilinta compared to clopidogrel on thrombotic events and bleeding were not significantly affected by CYP2C19 genotype.\nPharmacokinetics: Ticagrelor demonstrates dose proportional pharmacokinetics, which are similar in patients and healthy volunteers.\nAbsorption: Absorption of ticagrelor occurs with a median tmax of 1.5 hr (range 1.0-4.0). The formation of the major circulating metabolite AR-C124910XX (active) from ticagrelor occurs with a median tmax of 2.5 hour (range 1.5-5.0).\nThe mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor is about 36%, (range 30%-42%). Ingestion of a high-fat meal had no effect on ticagrelor Cmax, but resulted in a 21% increase in area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC). The Cmax of its major metabolite was decreased by 22% with no change in AUC. BRILINTA can be taken with or without food.\nTicagrelor as crushed tablets mixed in water, given orally or administered through a nasogastric tube into the stomach, is bioequivalent to whole tablets (AUC and Cmax within 80-125% for ticagrelor and the active metabolite). Initial exposure (0.5 and 1 hour post-dose) from crushed ticagrelor mixed in water was higher compared to whole tablets, with a generally identical concentration profile thereafter (2 to 48 hours).\nDistribution: The steady state volume of distribution of ticagrelor is 88 L. Ticagrelor and the active metabolite are extensively bound to human plasma proteins (>99%).\nMetabolism: CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. Ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and inhibitors. The systemic exposure to the active metabolite is approximately 30-40% of the exposure of ticagrelor.\nExcretion: The primary route of ticagrelor elimination is hepatic metabolism. When radiolabeled ticagrelor is administered, the mean recovery of radioactivity is approximately 84% (58% in feces, 26% in urine). Recoveries of ticagrelor and the active metabolite in urine were both less than 1% of the dose. The primary route of elimination for the major metabolite of ticagrelor is most likely to be biliary secretion. The mean t½ is approximately 7 hours for ticagrelor and 9 hours for the active metabolite.\nSpecial Populations: The effects of age, gender, ethnicity, renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 6. Effects are modest and do not require dose adjustment. (See Figure 6.)\nPediatric: Ticagrelor has not been evaluated in a pediatric population (see Precautions).\nBody Weight: No dose adjustment is necessary for ticagrelor based on weight.\nSmoking: Habitual smoking increased population mean clearance of ticagrelor by approximately 22% when compared to non-smokers. No dose adjustment is necessary for ticagrelor based on smoking status.\nEffects of Other Drugs on BRILINTA : CYP3A4 is the major enzyme responsible for ticagrelor metabolism and the formation of its major active metabolite. The effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor are presented in Figure 7 as change relative to ticagrelor given alone (test/reference). Strong CYP3A inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin) substantially increase ticagrelor exposure. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors have lesser effects (e.g. diltiazem). CYP3A inducers (eg, rifampin) substantially reduce ticagrelor blood levels. P-gp inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporine) increase ticagrelor exposure. (See Figure 7.)\nEffects of BRILINTA on Other Drugs: In vitro metabolism studies demonstrate that ticagrelor and its major active metabolite are weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, potential activators of CYP3A5 and inhibitors of the P-gp transporter. Ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were shown to have no inhibitory effect on human CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 activity. For specific in vivo effects on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgesterol, tolbutamide, digoxin and cyclosporine, see Figure 8.\nToxicology: Nonclinical Toxicology: Carcinogenesis: Ticagrelor was not carcinogenic in the mouse at doses up to 250 mg/kg/day or in the male rat at doses up to 120 mg/kg/day [19 and 15 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 90 mg twice daily on the basis of AUC, respectively]. Uterine carcinomas, uterine adenocarcinomas and hepatocellular adenomas were seen in female rats at doses of 180 mg/kg/day (29-fold the maximally recommended dose of 90 mg twice daily on the basis of AUC), whereas 60 mg/kg/day (8-fold the MRHD based on AUC) was not carcinogenic in female rats.\nMutagenesis: Ticagrelor did not demonstrate genotoxicity when tested in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity test, mouse lymphoma assay and the rat micronucleus test. The active O-demethylated metabolite did not demonstrate genotoxicity in the Ames assay and mouse lymphoma assay.\nImpairment of Fertility: Ticagrelor had no effect on male fertility at doses up to 180 mg/kg/day or on female fertility at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (>15-fold the MRHD on the basis of AUC). Doses of =10 mg/kg/day given to female rats caused an increased incidence of irregular duration estrus cycles (1.5-fold the MRHD based on AUC).",

      "indication": "Caduet is indicated in patients for whom treatment with both amlodipine and atorvastatin is appropriate.\nAmlodipine is indicated for treatment of hypertension and can be used as the sole agent to control blood pressure in the majority of patients. Patients not adequately controlled on a single antihypertensive agent may benefit from the addition of amlodipine, which has been used in combination with a thiazide diuretic, ß-adrenoreceptor blocking agent or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.\nAmlodipine is indicated for the treatment of myocardial ischaemia, whether due to fixed obstruction (stable angina) and/or vasospasm/vasoconstriction (prinzmetal's or variant angina) or coronary vasculature. Amlodipine may be used where the clinical presentation suggests a possible vasospastic/vasoconstriction has not been confirmed.\nAmlodipine may be used alone, as monotherapy, or in combination with other antianginal drugs in patients with angina that is refractory to nitrates and/or adequate doses or ß-blockers.\nAtorvastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, apoliprotein B and triglycerides in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, combined (mixed) hyperlipidemia, and heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia when response to diet and other non-pharmacological measure are inadequate.",
      "dosage": "General Considerations: Caduet is a combination product targeting concomitant cardiovascular conditions, hypertension/angina and dyslipidemia.\nThe dosage range for Caduet is 5/10 mg to a maximum dose of 10/80 mg once daily. The starting dose and maintenance dose should be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance for each individual component in the treatment of hypertension/angina and dyslipidemia. Current treatment guidelines should be consulted to establish treatment goals for patients based on their baseline characteristics. Doses may be taken at any time of the day with or without food.\nAs a component of multiple-risk factor intervention, Caduet should be used in addition to non-pharmacological measures including an appropriate diet, exercise and weight reduction in obese patients, smoking cessation, and to treat underlying medical problems when the response to these measures have been inadequate.\nFollowing initiation and/or titration of Caduet, lipid levels should be analyzed and blood pressure be measured within 2-4 weeks, and dosage of amlodipine and atorvastatin components should be adjusted accordingly. Titration for blood pressure response may proceed more rapidly if clinically warranted.\nInitial Therapy: Caduet may be used to initiate treatment in patients with hyperlipidemia and with either hypertension or angina. The recommended starting dose of Caduet should be based on the appropriate combination of recommendations for the amlodipine and atorvastatin components considered separately. The maximum dose of the amlodipine component of Caduet is 10 mg once daily. The maximum dose of the atorvastatin component of Caduet is 80 mg once daily.\nIf titrated dose is required, atorvastatin can be added separately to the combination of Caduet.\nSubstitution Therapy: Caduet may be substituted for its individually titrated components. Patients may be given the equivalent dose of Caduet or a dose of Caduet with increased amounts of amlodipine, atorvastatin or both for additional antianginal effects, blood pressure- or lipid-lowering effect.\nCaduet may be used to provide additional therapy for patients already on one of its components. As initial therapy for one indication and continuation of treatment of the other, the recommended starting dose of Caduet should be selected based on continuation of the component being used previously and on the recommended starting dose for the component being added.\nConcomitant Medication: The amlodipine component of Caduet has been safely co-administered with thiazide diuretics, a- and ß-blockers, ACE inhibitors, long-acting nitrates and with sublingual nitroglycerin. Caduet has also been safely administered with the aforementioned medicines.\nThe atorvastatin component of Caduet may be used in combination with a bile acid-binding resin for additive effect on lipid-lowering. The combination of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and fibrates should generally be avoided (see Precautions and Interactions).\nSpecial Populations and Special Considerations for Dosing: Primary Hypercholesterolemia and Combined (Mixed) Hyperlipidemia (Atorvastatin Studies): The majority of patients are controlled with atorvastatin 10 mg once daily. A therapeutic response is evident within 2 weeks and the maximum response is usually achieved within 4 weeks. The response is maintained during chronic therapy.\nHomozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) (Atorvastatin Studies): In a compassionate-use study of patients with homozygous FH, most patients responded to atorvastatin 80 mg with a >15% reduction in LDL-C (18-45%).\nUse in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function: Caduet should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment. (See Contraindications and Precautions.)\nUse in Patients with Impaired Renal Function: No adjustment of the dose is required in patients with impaired renal function.\nElderly: No adjustment of the dose is required in elderly patients.\nChildren: There have been no studies conducted to determine the safety or effectiveness of Caduet (combination product) in pediatric populations. Therefore, use in children population is not recommended.\nStudies with Amlodipine: Hypertensive Pediatric Patients 6-17 Years: The recommended oral dose is 2.5-5 mg once daily. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients (see Pharmacology: Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics under Actions).\nThe effect of amlodipine on blood pressure in patients <6 years is not known.\nStudies with Atorvastatin: Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients 10-17 years: The recommended starting dose of atorvastatin is 10 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses >20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy (see Indications and Pharmacology: Pharmacodynamics under Actions).\nAdjustments should be made at intervals of =4 weeks.\nUse in Combination with Other Medicinal Compounds: Studies with Atorvastatin: In cases where co-administration of atorvastatin with cyclosporine is necessary, the dose of atorvastatin should not exceed 10 mg (see Precautions and Interactions).",
      "over-dosage": "There is no information on overdosage with amlodipine/atorvastatin in humans.\nDue to amlodipine's and atorvastatin's extensive drug-binding to plasma proteins, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance amlodipine/atorvastatin clearance (see Renal Insufficiency under Pharmacokinetics under Actions).\nSymptoms: Additional data on amlodipine ingestion suggest that gross overdosage could result in excessive peripheral vasodilatation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported.\nTreatment: Administration of activated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to 2 hrs after ingestion of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption. Gastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. Clinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdosage calls for active cardiovascular support including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium-channel blockade.\nAdditional data on atorvastatin ingestion, suggest that there is no specific treatment for atorvastatin overdosage. Should an overdose occur, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted as required.",
      "administration": "May be taken with or without food.",
      "contra-indications": "Known hypersensitivity to dihydropyridines, amlodipine, atorvastatin or any component of Caduet.\nActive liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases exceeding 3 times the upper limit of normal. Or who are pregnant, breastfeeding or of childbearing potential not using adequate contraceptive measures. Caduet should be administered to women of childbearing age only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards to the fetus.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: Caduet is contraindicated in pregnancy due to the atorvastatin component. Women of childbearing potential should use adequate contraceptive measures. Caduet should be administered to women of childbearing age only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the potential hazards to the fetus.\nCaduet is contraindicated while breastfeeding due to the atorvastatin component. It is not known whether atorvastatin is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, women taking Caduet should not breastfeed.\nSafety of amlodipine in human pregnancy or lactation has not been established. Amlodipine does not demonstrate toxicity in animal reproductive studies other than to delay parturition and prolong labor in rates at a dose level 50 times the maximum recommended dose in humans.",
      "special-precautions": "Increased Angina and/or MI: Rarely, patients particularly those with severe obstructive coronary artery disease have developed documented increased frequency, duration and/or severity of angina or acute MI on starting calcium-channel blocker therapy or at the time of dosage increase. The mechanism of this effect has not been elucidated.\nUse in Patients with Heart Failure: In a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine-treated patients with NYHA III and IV heart failure of non-ischemic etiology, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of pulmonary edema despite of no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo (see Pharmacology: Pharmacodynamics under Actions).\nUse in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function (see also Contraindications): Hepatic Effects: As with other lipid-lowering agents of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor class, moderate [>3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)] elevations of serum transaminases have been reported following therapy with atorvastatin. Liver function was monitored during pre-marketing as well as post-marketing clinical studies of atorvastatin given at doses of 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg.\nPersistent increases in serum transaminases (>3 times ULN on =2 occasions) occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in these clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6% and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg respectively. Increases were generally not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. When the dosage of atorvastatin was reduced, or drug treatment interrupted or discontinued, transaminase levels returned to pre-treatment levels. Most patients continued treatment on a reduced dose of atorvastatin without sequelae.\nLiver function tests should be performed before the initiation of treatment and periodically thereafter. Patients who develop any signs or symptoms suggesting liver injury should have liver function tests performed. Patients who develop increased transaminase levels should be monitored until the abnormality(ies) resolve(s). Should an increase in ALT or AST of >3 times times the ULN persist, reduction of dose or withdrawal of Caduet is recommended. Atorvastatin can cause an elevation in transaminases (see Adverse Reactions).\nCaduet should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of Caduet (see Contraindications).\nSkeletal Muscle Effects: Myalgia has been reported in atorvastatin-treated patients (see Adverse Reactions). Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values >10x ULN, should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. Amlodipine/atorvastatin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. The risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, niacin, or azole antifungals. Many of these drugs inhibit cytochrome P-450 3A4 metabolism and/or drug transport. CYP3A4 is the primary hepatic isozymes known to be involved in the biotransformation of atorvastatin. Physicians considering combined therapy with atorvastatin and fibric acid derivatives, erythromycin, immunosuppressive drugs, azole antifungals or lipid-modifying doses of niacin should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks and should carefully monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly during the initial months of therapy and during any periods of upward dosage titration of either drug. Therefore, the lower starting and maintenance dose of the atorvastatin component should also be considered when taken concomitantly with the aforementioned drugs. (See Interactions.) Periodic CPK determinations may be considered in such situations, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy. Caduet may cause an elevation of CPK due to the atorvastatin component (see Adverse Reactions).\nAs with other drugs in the class of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. Caduet therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a risk factor predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (eg, severe acute infection, hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and uncontrolled seizures). Control of hypertension may be continued with the appropriate dose of amlodipine.\nHemorrhagic Stroke: A post-hoc analysis of a clinical study in 4731 patients without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months and were initiated on atorvastatin 80 mg, revealed a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin 80 mg group compared to placebo (55 atorvastatin vs 33 placebo). Patients with hemorrhagic stroke on entry appeared to be at increased risk for recurrent hemorrhagic stroke (7 atorvastatin vs 2 placebo). However, in patients treated with atorvastatin 80 mg, there were fewer strokes of any type (265 vs 311) and fewer CHD events (123 vs 204).\nBeta-Blocker Withdrawal: The amlodipine component of Caduet is not a ß-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt ß-blocker withdrawal; any such withdrawal should be by gradual reduction of the dose of b-blocker.\nEndocrine Function: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors eg, the atorvastatin component of Caduet interferes with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal and/or gonadal steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on male fertility have not been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exercised if an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones eg, ketoconazole, spironolactone and cimetidine.\nCentral Nervous System Toxicity: Studies with Atorvastatin: Brain hemorrhage was seen in a female dog treated with atorvastatin calcium for 3 months at a dose equivalent to atorvastatin 120 mg/kg/day. Brain hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of escalating doses of atorvastatin calcium equivalent to up to atorvastatin 280 mg/kg/day. The 120 mg/kg dose of atorvastatin resulted in a systemic exposure approximately 16 times the human plasma area under the curve (AUC, 0-24 hrs) based on the maximum human dose of 80 mg/day. A single tonic convulsion was seen in each of 2 male dogs (one treated with atorvastatin calcium at a dose equivalent to atorvastatin 10 mg/kg/day and one at a dose equivalent to atorvastatin 120 mg/kg/day) in a 2-year study. No CNS lesions have been observed in mice after chronic treatment of up to 2 years at doses of atorvastatin calcium equivalent to up to atorvastatin 400 mg/kg/day or in rats at doses equivalent to up to atorvastatin 100 mg/kg/day. These doses were 6-11 times (mouse) and 8-16 times (rat) the human AUC(0-24) based on the maximum recommended human dose of atorvastatin 80 mg/day.\nCNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with other members of the HMG-CoA reductase class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dose-dependent fashion at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose.\nInformation For the Patient: Patients should be advised to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.\nAdolescent females and women of childbearing potential should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on amlodipine/atorvastatin therapy (see Contraindications).\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: Based on the available information on amlodipine and atorvastatin, Caduet is unlikely to impair a patients ability to drive or use machinery.",
      "adverse-reactions": "Combination therapy with amlodipine and atorvastatin has been evaluated for safety in 1092 patients in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies treated for concomitant hypertension and dyslipidemia. In clinical trials, no adverse events peculiar to combination therapy with amlodipine and atorvastatin have been observed. Adverse events have been limited to those that were reported previously with amlodipine and/or atorvastatin (see respective adverse event experiences as follows).\nIn general, combination therapy with amlodipine and atorvastatin was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse events have been mild or moderate in severity. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events or laboratory abnormalities was required in only 5.1% of patients treated with both amlodipine and atorvastatin compared to 4% of patients given placebo.\nThe following information is based on clinical trials and post-marketing experience with amlodipine and atorvastatin.\nAmlodipine Experience: The following events occurred in 1% but >0.1% of patients treated with amlodipine in controlled-clinical trials or under conditions of open trials or marketing experience where a causal relationship is uncertain; the events are listed to alert the physician to a possible relationship: Cardiovascular: Arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, chest pain, hypotension, peripheral ischemia, syncope, tachycardia, postural dizziness, postural hypotension, vasculitis.\nCentral and Peripheral Nervous System: Hypoesthesia, peripheral neuropathy, paresthesia, tremor, vertigo.\nGastrointestinal: Anorexia, constipation, dyspepsia, **dysphagia, diarrhea, flatulence, pancreatitis, vomiting, gingival hyperplasia.\nGeneral: Allergic reaction, asthenia, **back pain, hot flushes, malaise, pain, rigors, weight gain, decreased weight.\nMusculoskeletal System: Arthralgia, arthrosis, muscle cramps, **myalgia.\nPsychiatric: Sexual dysfunction, (male** and female), insomnia, nervousness, depression, abnormal dreams, anxiety, depersonalization.\nRespiratory System: Dyspnea, **epistaxis.\nSkin and Appendages: Angioedema, erythema multiforme, pruritus, **rash, **erythematous rash, maculopapular rash.\n**These events occurred in <1% in placebo-controlled-trials but the incidence of these side effects was between 1% and 2% in all multiple dose studies.\nSpecial Senses: Abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye pain, tinnitus.\nUrinary System: Frequent micturition, micturition disorder, nocturia.\nAutonomic Nervous System: Dry mouth, increased sweating.\nMetabolic and Nutritional: Hyperglycemia and thirst.\nHemapoietic: Leucopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia.\nThe following events occurred in =0.1% of patients treated with amlodipine in controlled-clinical trials or under conditions of open trials or marketing experience: Cardiac failure, pulse irregularity, extrasystoles, skin discoloration, urticaria, skin dryness, alopecia, dermatitis, muscle weakness, twitching, ataxia, hypertonia, migraine, cold and clammy skin, apathy, agitation, amnesia, gastritis, increased appetite, loose stools, coughing, rhinitis, dysuria, polyuria, parosmia, taste perversion, abnormal visual accomodation and xerophthalmia.\nOther reactions occurred sporadically and cannot be distiguished from medications or concurrent disease states eg, myocardial infarction and angina.\nAmlodipine therapy has not been associated with clinically significant changes in routine laboratory tests. No clinically relevant changes were noted in serum potassium and glucose, total triglycerides and cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen or creatinine.\nIn post-marketing experience, the following additional undesirable effects have been reported with amlodipine: Autonomic Nervous: Dry mouth, increased sweating.\nBody as a Whole: Asthenia, back pain, malaise, pain, increase/decrease weight.\nCardiovascular, General: Hypotension, syncope.\nCentral and Peripheral Nervous: Hypertonia, hypoesthesia/paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, tremor.\nEndocrine: Gynecomastia.\nGastrointestinal: Altered bowel habits, dyspepsia (including gastritis), gingival hyperplasia, pancreatitis, vomiting.\nMetabolic/Nutritional: Hyperglycemia.\nMusculoskeletal: Arthralgia, muscle cramps, myalgia.\nPlatelet/Bleeding/Clotting: Purpura, thrombocytopenia.\nPsychiatric: Impotence, insomnia, mood changes.\nRespiratory: Coughing, dyspnea, rhinitis.\nSkin/Appendages: Alopecia, skin discoloration, urticaria.\nSpecial Senses: Taste perversion, tinnitus.\nUrinary: Increased urinary frequency, micturition disorder, nocturia.\nVascular (Extracardiac): Vasculitis.\nVision: Visual disturbances.\nWhite Blood Cell/R.E.S.: Leucopenia.\nHepatobiliary: Hepatitis, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations have also been reported very infrequently (mostly consistent with cholestasis). Some cases severe enough to require hospitalization have been reported in association with use of amlodipine. In many instances, causal association is uncertain.\nRarely: Allergic reaction including pruritus, rash, angioedema and erythema multiforme.\nAs with other calcium-channel blockers the following adverse events have been rarely reported and cannot be distinguished from the natural history of the underlying disease: Myocardial infarction, arrhythmia (including bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation) and chest pain.\nAtorvastatin Experience: Atorvastatin is generally well-tolerated. Adverse reactions have usually been mild and transient. Less than 2% of patients were discontinued from clinical trials due to side effects attributed to atorvastatin.\nThe following adverse events were reported regardless of causality assessment in patients treated with atorvastatin in clinical trials.\nAdverse Events that Occurred in <2% of Patients: Body as a Whole: Chest pain, face edema, fever, neck rigidity, malaise, photosensitivity reaction, generalized edema.\nDigestive System: Nausea, gastroenteritis, abnormal liver function tests, colitis, vomiting, gastritis, dry mouth, rectal hemorrhage, esophagitis, eructation, glossitis, mouth ulceration, anorexia, increased appetite, stomatitis, biliary pain, cheilitis, duodenal ulcer, dysphagia, enteritis, melena, gum hemorrhage, stomach ulcer, tenesmus, ulcerative stomatitis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, cholestatic jaundice.\nRespiratory System: Bronchitis, rhinitis, pneumonia, dyspnea, asthma, epistaxis.\nNervous System: Insomnia, dizziness, paresthesia, somnolence, amnesia, abnormal dreams, decreased libido, emotional lability, incoordination, peripheral neuropathy, torticollis, facial paralysis, hyperkinesia, depression, hyperthesia, hypertonia.\nMusculoskeletal System: Arthritis, leg cramps, bursitis, tenosynovitis, myasthenia, tendinous contracture, myositis.\nSkin and Appendages: Pruritus, contact dermatitis, alopecia, dry skin, sweating, acne, urticaria, eczema, seborrhea, skin ulcer.\nUrogenital System: Urinary tract infection, frequent urination, cystitis, hematuria, impotence, dysuria, kidney calculus, nocturia, epididymitis, fibrocystic breast, vaginal hemorrhage, albuminuria, breast enlargement, metrorrhagia, nephritis, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urinary urgency, abnormal ejaculation, uterine hemorrhage.\nSpecial Senses: Amblyopia, tinnitus, dry eyes, refraction disorder, eye hemorrhage, deafness, glaucoma, parosmia, taste loss, taste perversion.\nCardiovascular System: Palpitation, vasodilation, syncope, migraine, postural hypotension, phlebitis, arrythmia, angina pectoris, hypertension.\nMetabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Peripheral edema, hyperglycemia, increased creatinine phosphokinase, gout, weight gain, hypoglycemia.\nHemic and Lymphatic System: Ecchymosis, anemia, lymphadenopathy, thrombocytopenia, petechia.\nPost-Introduction Reports with Atorvastatin: Adverse events associated with atorvastatin therapy reported since market introduction, that are not listed previously regardless of causality assessment include as follows: anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolyis) and rhabdomyolysis.\nAdverse Events that Occurred in 2% of Patients: In post-marketing experience, the following additional undesirable effects have been reported with atorvastatin: Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Thrombocytopenia.\nImmune System Disorders: Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis).\nInjury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications: Tendon rupture.\nMetabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Weight gain.\nNervous System Disorders: Hypoesthesia, amnesia, dizziness, dysgeusia.\nEar and Labyrinth Disorders: Tinnitus.\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, bullous rashes, urticaria.\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Rhabdomyolysis, arthralgia, back pain.\nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Chest pain, peripheral edema, malaise, fatigue.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "Data from a drug-drug interaction study involving 10 mg of amlodipine and 80 mg of atorvastatin in healthy subjects indicate that the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not altered when the drugs are co-administered. The effect of amlodipine on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin showed no effect on the Cmax: 91% (90% confidence interval: 80-103%), but the AUC of atorvastatin increased by 18% (90% confidence interval: 109-127%) in the presence of amlodipine.\nNo drug interaction studies have been conducted with Caduet and other drugs, although studies have been conducted in the individual amlodipine and atorvastatin components, as described as follows:\nIn Studies with Amlodipine: Amlodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics, a-blockers, ß-blockers, ACE inhibitors, long-acting nitrates, sublingual glyceryl trinitrate, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics and oral hypoglycemic drugs.\nIn vitro data from studies with human plasma, indicate that amlodipine has no effect on protein-binding of the drugs tested (digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin or indomethacin).\nIn the following studies, there were no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of either amlodipine or another drug within the study, when co-administered.\nSpecial Studies: Effect of Other Agents on Amlodipine: Cimetidine: Co-administration of cimetidine did not alter the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine.\nGrapefruit Juice: Co-administration of 240 mL of grapefruit juice with a single oral dose of amlodipine 10 mg in 20 healthy volunteers had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine.\nAluminum/Magnesium (Antacid): Co-administration of an aluminum/magnesium antacid with a single dose of amlodipine had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine.\nSildenafil: A single 100-mg dose of sildenafil in subjects with essential hypertension had no effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of amlodipine. When amlodipine and sildenafil were used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect.\nSpecial Studies: Effect of Amlodipine on Other Agents: Digoxin: Co-administration of amlodipine with digoxin did not change serum digoxin levels or digoxin renal clearance in normal volunteers.\nEthanol (Alcohol): Single and multiple 10 mg doses of amlodipine had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of ethanol.\nWarfarin: Co-administration of amlodipine with warfarin did not change the warfarin prothrombin response time.\nCyclosporine: Pharmacokinetic studies with cyclosporine have demonstrated that amlodipine does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine.\nDrug/Laboratory Test Interactions: None known.\nIn Studies with Atorvastatin: The risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concurrent administration of cyclosporin, fibric acid derivatives, lipid-modifying doses of niacin or cytochrome P-450 3A4 inhibitors (eg, erythromycin and azole antifungals) (see Use in Combination with Other Medicinal Compounds under Dosage and Administration and Skeletal Muscle Effects under Precautions).\nInhibitors of Cytochrome P-450 3A4: Atorvastatin is metabolized by cytochrome P-450 3A4. Concomitant administration of atorvastatin with inhibitors of cytochrome P-450 3A4 can lead to increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. The extent of interaction and potentiation of effects depends on the variability of effect on cytochrome P-450 3A4.\nTransporter Inhibitors: Atorvastatin and atorvastatin metabolites are substrates of the OATP1B1 transporter. Inhibitors of the OATP1B1 (eg, cyclosporin) can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin. Concomitant administration of atorvastatin 10 mg and cyclosporin 5.2 mg/kg/day resulted in a 7.7-fold increase in exposure to atorvastatin (see also Use in Combination with Other Medicinal Compounds under Dosage and Administration).\nErythromycin/Clarithromycin: Co-administration of atorvastatin (10 mg once daily) and erythromycin (500 mg 4 times daily) or clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily), known inhibitors of cytochrome P-450 3A4, were associated with higher plasma concentrations of atorvastatin (see Skeletal Muscle Effects under Precautions).\nProtease Inhibitors: Co-administration of atorvastatin and protease inhibitors, known inhibitors of cytochrome P-450 3A4, was associated with increased plasma concentrations of atorvastatin.\nDiltiazem HCl: Co-administration of atorvastatin (40 mg) with diltiazem (240 mg) was associated with higher plasma concentrations of atorvastatin.\nCimetidine: An atorvastatin interaction study with cimetidine was conducted, and no clinically significant interactions were seen.\nItraconazole: Concomitant administration of atorvastatin (20-40 mg) and itraconazole (200 mg) was associated with an increase in atorvastatin AUC.\nGrapefruit Juice: Contains =1 components that inhibit CYP3A4 and can increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, especially with excessive grapefruit juice consumption (>1.2 L/day).\nInducers of Cytochrome P-450 3A: Concomitant administration of atorvastatin with inducers of cytochrome P-450 3A4 (eg, efavirenz, rifampin) can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin (cytochrome P-450 3A4 induction and inhibition of hepatocyte uptake transporter OATP1B1), simultaneous co-administration of atorvastatin with rifampin is recommended, as delayed administration of atorvastatin after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations.\nAntacids: Co-administration of atorvastatin with an oral antacid suspension containing magnesium and aluminum hydroxides decreases atorvastatin plasma concentrations by approximately 35%; however, LDL-C reduction was not altered.\nAntipyrine: Because atorvastatin does not affect the pharmacokinetics of antipyrine, interactions with other drugs metabolized via the same cytochrome isozymes are not expected.\nColestipol: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin were lower (approximately 25%) when colestipol was administered with atorvastatin. However, lipid effects were greater when atorvastatin and colestipol were co-administered than when either drug was given alone.\nDigoxin: When multiple doses of digoxin and atorvastatin 10 mg were co-administered, steady-state plasma digoxin concentrations were unaffected. However, digoxin concentrations increased approximately 20% following administration of digoxin with atorvastatin 80 mg daily. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately.\nAzithromycin: Co-administration of atorvastatin (10 mg once daily) and azithromycin (500 mg once daily) did not alter the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin.\nOral Contraceptives: Co-administration with an oral contraceptive containing norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol increases AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by approximately 30% and 20%, respectively. These increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.\nWarfarin: An atorvastatin interaction study with warfarin was conducted, and no clinically significant interactions were observed.\nOther Concomitant Therapy: In clinical studies, atorvastatin was used concomitantly with antihypertensive agents and estrogen replacement therapy without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. Interaction studies with specific agents have not been conducted.\nIncompatibilities: Not applicable.",

The empirical formula of atorvastatin calcium is (C33H34FN2O5)2Ca·3H2O.",
      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Amlodipine/Atorvastatin Pharmacodynamics: Caduet combines 2 mechanisms of action: The dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) action of amlodipine and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibition of atorvastatin. The amlodipine component of amlodipine/atorvastatin inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. The atorvastatin component of amlodipine/atorvastatin is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols including cholesterol.\nClinical Studies of Combined Amlodipine and Atorvastatin in Patients with Hypertension and Dyslipidemia: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 1660 patients with co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidemia, once daily treatment with 8 dose combinations of amlodipine and atorvastatin (5/10, 10/10, 5/20, 10/20, 5/40, 10/40, 5/80, or 10/80 mg) was compared versus amlodipine alone (5 or 10 mg), atorvastatin alone (10, 20, 40 or 80 mg), and placebo. In addition to concomitant hypertension and dyslipidemia, 15% of the patients had diabetes mellitus, 22% were smokers and 14% had a positive family history of cardiovascular disease. At 8 weeks, all 8 combination-treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant dose-related reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBlood Pressure), diastolic blood pressure (DBlood Pressure) and LDL-C compared to placebo, with no overall modification of effect of either component on SBlood Pressure, DBlood Pressure and LDL-C (see Table 1).\nIn an open-label trial, 1220 patients with co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidemia received elective dose-titration with amlodipine/atorvastatin over a 14-week period. Patients were required to have uncontrolled blood pressure to enter the trial (whether or not they were using antihypertensive medications at enrollment; patients were allowed to continue on previous antihypertensives, other than calcium-channel blockers, during the 14-week dose-titration period) but could enter with either controlled or uncontrolled LDL-C. As a result, no patient entered the trial with both blood pressure and LDL-C controlled, and neither was controlled in 62% of patients. Treatment with amlodipine/atorvastatin reduced mean blood pressure by -17.1 mmHg systolic and -9.6 mmHg diastolic, and reduced mean LDL-C by -32.7%, resulting in control of both blood pressure and LDL-C for 58% of these patients (controlled blood pressure and LDL-C were defined, respectively, as <140/90 mmHg and <160 mg/dL for patients with co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidemia only; <140/90 mmHg and <130 mg/dL for patients with co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidemia plus 1 additional cardiovascular risk factor, excluding known coronary heart disease (CHD) or diabetes mellitus; and <130/85 mmHg and <100 mg/dL for patients with co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidemia plus known CHD, diabetes mellitus, or other atherosclerotic disease). Only 13% of the patients in this trial used amlodipine/atorvastatin as initial therapy for co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidemia, whereas the amlodipine component of amlodipine/atorvastatin comprised add-on therapy for hypertension in 56% of patients, including patients for whom the atorvastatin component of amlodipine/atorvastatin comprised initial therapy for dyslipidemia (20%), a substitution for atorvastatin taken previously (18%), or a switch from another statin (18%). When evaluated according to use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications at enrollment, results showed that both blood pressure and LDL-C were brought under control for 65% of patients who used amlodipine/atorvastatin as initial therapy for co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidemia and for 55-64% of patients for whom the amlodipine component of amlodipine/atorvastatin constituted add-on therapy for hypertension (55% for such patients who had previously used lipid-lowering medications other than atorvastatin, 58% for such patients who had previously used atorvastatin, and 64% for such patients who had not previously used lipid-lowering medications).\nAmlodipine Pharmacodynamics: Amlodipine is a calcium-ion influx inhibitor (slow channel blocker or calcium-ion antagonist) and inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle.\nThe mechanism of the antihypertensive action of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle. The precise mechanism by which amlodipine relieves angina has not been fully determined but amlodipine reduces total ischemic burden by the following 2 actions.\nAmlodipine dilates peripheral arterioles and thus, reduces the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works. Since the heart rate remains stable, this unloading of the heart reduces myocardial energy consumption and oxygen requirements.\nThe mechanism of action of amlodipine also probably involves dilatation of the main coronary arteries and coronary arterioles, both in normal and ischemic regions. This dilatation increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients with coronary artery spasm (Prinzmetal's or variant angina) and blunts smoking-induced coronary vasoconstriction.\nIn patients with hypertension, once-daily dosing provides clinically significant reductions of blood pressure in both the supine and standing positions throughout the 24-hr interval. Due to the slow onset of action, acute hypotension is not a feature of amlodipine administration.\nIn patients with angina, once-daily administration of amlodipine increases total exercise time, time to angina onset, and time to 1 mm ST segment depression, and decreases both angina attack frequency and nitroglycerin tablet consumption.\nAmlodipine has not been associated with any adverse metabolic effects or changes in plasma lipids and is suitable for use in patients with asthma, diabetes and gout.\nUse in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The effects of amlodipine on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the progression of coronary atherosclerosis, and carotid atherosclerosis were studied in the Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Vascular Effects of Norvasc Trial (PREVENT). This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed 825 patients with angiographically defined CAD for 3 years. The population included patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) (45%), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) at baseline (42%) or history of angina (69%). Severity of CAD ranged from 1-vessel disease (45% of patients) to 3+ vessel disease (21%). Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (DBlood Pressure >95 mmHg) were excluded from the study. Major cardiovascular events were adjudicated by a blinded endpoint committee. Although there were no demonstrable effects on the rate of progression of coronary artery lesions, amlodipine arrested the progression of carotid intima-media thickening. A significant reduction (-31%) was observed in the amlodipine-treated patients in the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, PTCA, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hospitalization for unstable angina, and worsening congestive heart failure (Congestive heart failure). A significant reduction (-42%) in revascularization procedures (PTCA and CABG) was also seen in the amlodipine-treated patients. Fewer hospitalizations (-33%) were seen for unstable angina in amlodipine patients than in the placebo group.\nTreatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT): A randomized double-blind morbidity-mortality study called the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was performed to compare newer drug therapies: Amlodipine 2.5-10 mg/day (calcium channel blocker) or lisinopril 10-40 mg/day (ACE inhibitor) as 1st-line therapies to that of the thiazide-diuretic, chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg/day in mild to moderate hypertension.\nA total of 33,357 hypertensive patients =55 years were randomized and followed for a mean of 4.9 years. The patients had at least 1 additional CHD risk factor, including MI or stroke >6 months or documentation of other atherosclerotic CVD (overall 51.5%), type 2 diabetes (36.1%), HDL-C <35 mg/dL (11.6%), left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed by electrocardiogram or echocardiography (20.9%), current cigarette smoking (21.9%).\nThe primary endpoint was a composite of fatal CHD or non-fatal myocardial infarction. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between amlodipine-based therapy and chlorthalidone-based therapy: RR 0.98 95% CI (0.9-1.07) p=0.65. In addition, there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between amlodipine-based therapy and chlorthalidone-based therapy: RR 0.96 95% CI (0.89-1.02) p=0.2.\nUse in Patients with Heart Failure: Hemodynamic studies and exercise based controlled clinical trials in NYHA Class II-IV heart failure patients have shown that amlodipine did not lead to clinical deterioration as measured by exercise tolerance, left ventricular ejection fraction and clinical symptomatology.\nA placebo-controlled study (PRAISE) designed to evaluate patients in NYHA Class III-IV heart failure receiving digoxin, diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has shown that amlodipine did not lead to an increase in risk of mortality or combined mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure.\nIn a follow-up, long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA III and IV heart failure without clinical symptoms or objective findings suggestive of underlying ischemic disease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitors, digitalis, and diuretics, amlodipine had no effect on total or cardiovascular mortality. In this same population, amlodipine was associated with increased reports of pulmonary edema despite no significant difference in the incidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo.\nAtorvastatin Pharmacodynamics: Atorvastatin is a selective, competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. In patients with homozygous and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia, atorvastatin reduces total-C (total cholesterol), LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and apo B (apolipoprotein B). Atorvastatin also reduces VLDL-C (very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and TG (triglycerides) and produces variable increases in HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol).\nAtorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein serum concentration by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface for enhanced uptake and catabolism of LDL.\nAtorvastatin reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles. Atorvastatin produces a profound and sustained increase in LDL receptor activity coupled with a beneficial change in the quality of circulating LDL particles. Atorvastatin is effective in reducing LDL in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, a population that has not normally responded to lipid-lowering medication.\nAtorvastatin and some of its metabolites are pharmacologically active in humans. The primary site of action of atorvastatin is the liver, which is the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. LDL-C reduction correlates better with drug dose than it does with systemic drug concentration. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response (see Dosage and Administration).\nIn a dose-response study, atorvastatin (10-80 mg) reduced total-C (30-46%), LDL-C (41-61%), apo B (34-50%) and TG (14-33%). These results are consistent in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, nonfamilial forms of hypercholesterolemia and mixed hyperlipidemia, including patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.\nIn patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia, atorvastatin reduces total-C, LDL-C, VLDL-C, apo B, TG and non-HDL-C, and increases HDL-C. In patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia, atorvastatin reduces IDL-C (intermediate density lipoprotein cholesterol).\nIn patients with Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb hyperlipoproteinemia pooled from 24 controlled trials, the median percent increases from baseline in HDL-C for atorvastatin (10-80 mg) were 5.1-8.7% in a non-dose-related manner. Additionally, analysis of this pooled data demonstrated significant dose-related decreases in total-C/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios, ranging from -29 to -44% and -37 to -55%, respectively.\nPrevention of Cardiovascular Complications: In the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial Lipid Lowering Arm (ASCOT-LLA), the effect of atorvastatin on fatal and non-fatal CHD was assessed in 10,305 hypertensive patients 40-80 years (mean of 63 years), without a previous myocardial infarction and with TC levels <6.5 mmol/L (251 mg/dL). Additionally, all patients had at least 3 of the following cardiovascular risk factors: Male gender, age >55 years, smoking, diabetes, history of CHD in a 1st-degree relative, TC:HDL >6, peripheral vascular disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, prior cerebrovascular event, specific ECG abnormality, proteinuria/albuminuria. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were treated with antihypertensive therapy (Goal Blood Pressure <140/90 mmHg for non-diabetic patients, <130/80 mmHg for diabetic patients) and allocated to either atorvastatin 10 mg daily (n=5168) or placebo (n=5137).\nAs the effect of atorvastatin treatment compared to placebo exceeded the significance threshold during an interim analysis, the ASCOT-LLA was terminated early at 3.3 years instead of 5 years. Additionally, blood pressure was well controlled and similar in patients assigned to atorvastatin and placebo. These changes persisted throughout the treatment period.\nAtorvastatin significantly reduced the rate of the following events: See Table 2.\nThe total mortality and cardiovascular mortality have not been significantly reduced although a favorable trend was observed.\nHeterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by an open-label phase, 187 boys and postmenarchal girls 10-17 years (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or severe hypercholesterolemia were randomized to atorvastatin (n=140) or placebo (n=47) for 26 weeks and then all received atorvastatin for 26 weeks. Inclusion in the study required a baseline LDL-C level =190 mg/dL, or a baseline LDL-C =160 mg/dL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a 1st- or 2nd-degree relative. The mean baseline LDL-C value was 218.6 mg/dL (range: 138.5-385 mg/dL) in the atorvastatin group compared to 230 mg/dL (range: 160-324.5 mg/dL) in placebo group. The dosage of atorvastatin (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and up-titrated to 20 mg if the LDL-C level was >130 mg/dL. The number of atorvastatin-treated patients who required up-titration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the double-blind phase was 80 (57.1%).\nAtorvastatin significantly decreased plasma levels of total-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B during the 26 weeks double-blind phase (see Table 3).\nThe mean achieved LDL-C value was 130.7 mg/dL (range: 70-242 mg/dL) in the atorvastatin group compared to 228.5 mg/dL (range: 152-385 mg/dL) in the placebo group during the 26-week double-blind phase.\nIn this limited controlled study, there was no detectable effect on growth or sexual maturation in boys or on menstrual cycle length in girls. Atorvastatin has not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving prepubertal patients or patients <10 years. The safety and efficacy of doses >20 mg have not been studied in controlled trials in children. The long-term efficacy of atorvastatin therapy in childhood to reduce morbidity and mortality in adulthood has not been established.\nPharmacokinetics: Absorption: In Studies with Amlodipine/Atorvastatin: Following oral administration, 2 distinct peak plasma concentrations were observed. The first, within 1-2 hrs of administration, is attributable to atorvastatin; the 2nd, between 6 and 12 hrs after dosing is attributable to amlodipine. The rate and extent of absorption (bioavailability) of amlodipine and atorvastatin from amlodipine/atorvastatin are not significantly different from the bioavailability of amlodipine and atorvastatin from co-administration of amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets as assessed by Cmax: 101% (90% CI: 98, 104) and AUC: 100% (90% CI: 97, 103) for the amlodipine component and Cmax: 94% (90% CI: 85, 104) and AUC: 105% (90% CI: 99, 111) for the atorvastatin component, respectively.\nThe bioavailability of the amlodipine component of amlodipine/atorvastatin was not affected under the fed state as assessed by Cmax: 105% (90% CI: 99, 111) and AUC: 101% (90% CI: 97, 105) relative to the fasted state. Although food decreases the rate and extent of absorption of atorvastatin from amlodipine/atorvastatin by approximately 32% and 11%, respectively, as assessed by Cmax: 68% (90% CI 60, 79) and AUC: 89% (90% CI 83, 95) relative to the fasted state, similar reductions in plasma concentrations in the fed state have been seen with atorvastatin taken as monotherapy without reduction in LDL-C effect.\nIn Studies with Amlodipine: After oral administration of therapeutic doses, amlodipine is well absorbed with peak blood levels between 6-12 hrs post-dose. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64% and 80%. The volume of distribution is approximately 21 L/kg. In vitro studies have shown that approximately 97.5% of circulating amlodipine is bound to plasma proteins.\nAbsorption of amlodipine is unaffected by consumption of food.\nIn Studies with Atorvastatin: Atorvastatin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1-2 hrs. Extent of absorption and plasma atorvastatin concentrations increase in proportion to atorvastatin dose. Atorvastatin tablets are 95-99% bioavailable compared with solutions. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa and/or hepatic first-pass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25% and 9% respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDL-C reduction is similar whether atorvastatin is given with or without food. Plasma atorvastatin concentrations are lower (approximately 30% for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDL-C reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration (see Dosage and Administration).\nDistribution: In Studies with Atorvastatin: Mean volume of distribution of atorvastatin is approximately 381 L. Atorvastatin is =98% bound to plasma proteins. A red blood cell/plasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells.\nMetabolism and Excretion: In Studies with Amlodipine: The terminal plasma elimination half-life is about 35-50 hrs and is consistent with once-daily dosing. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after 7-8 days of consecutive dosing. Amlodipine is extensively metabolized by the liver to inactive metabolites with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of metabolites excreted in the urine.\nIn Studies with Atorvastatin: Atorvastatin is extensively metabolized to ortho- and para-hydroxylated derivatives and various ß-oxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and para-hydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of atorvastatin. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of atorvastatin metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P-450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of atorvastatin in humans following co-administration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme. In vitro studies also indicate that atorvastatin is a weak inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 3A4. Atorvastatin co-administration did not produce a clinically significant effect in plasma concentrations of terfenadine, a compound predominantly metabolized by cytochrome P-450 3A4; therefore, it is unlikely that atorvastatin will significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of other cytochrome P-450 3A4 substrates (see Interactions). In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation.\nAtorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extrahepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of atorvastatin in humans is approximately 14 hrs, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20-30 hrs due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2% of the dose of atorvastatin is recovered in urine following oral administration.\nSpecial Populations: Hepatic Insufficiency: In Studies with Atorvastatin: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are markedly increased (approximately 16-fold in Cmax and 11-fold in AUC) in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease (Child-Pugh B) (see Contraindications).\nRenal Insufficiency (see Dosage and Administration): In Studies with Amlodipine: Changes in amlodipine plasma concentrations are not correlated with degree of renal impairment. Amlodipine is not dialyzable.\nIn Studies with Atorvastatin: Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or lipid effects of atorvastatin. Thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary.\nGender: In Studies with Atorvastatin: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin in women differ (approximately 20% higher for Cmax and 10% lower for AUC) from those in men. However, there were no clinically significant differences in lipid effects between men and women.\nElderly: In Studies with Amlodipine: The time to reach peak plasma concentrations of amlodipine is similar in elderly and younger subjects. Amlodipine clearance tends to be decreased with resulting increases in AUC and elimination half-life in elderly patients. Increases in AUC and elimination half-life in patients with congestive heart failure were as expected for the patient age group studied. Amlodipine used at similar doses in elderly or younger patients, is equally well tolerated.\nIn Studies with Atorvastatin: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin are higher (approximately 40% for Cmax and 30% for AUC) in healthy, elderly subjects (=65 years) than in young adults. The ACCESS study specifically evaluated elderly patients with respect to reaching their NCEP treatment goals. The study included 1087 patients <65 years, 815 patients >65 years and 185 patients >75 years. No differences in safety, efficacy or lipid treatment goal attainment were observed between elderly patients and the overall population.\nPediatrics: In Studies with Amlodipine: In 1 clinical chronic exposure study, 73 hypertensive pediatric patients, 12 months to =17 years, amlodipine was dosed at an average daily dose of 0.17 mg/kg. Clearance for subjects with the median weight of 45 kg were 23.7 and 17.6 L/hr for males and females, respectively. This is in a similar range to the published estimates of 24.8 L/hr in a 70-kg adult. The average estimate for volume of distribution for a 45-kg patient was 1130 L (25.11 L/kg). Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hr dosing interval was observed with little difference in peak and trough variation effect. When compared with historical adult pharmacokinetics, the parameters observed in this study indicate that once daily dosing is appropriate.\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: Carcinogenesis: In Studies with Amlodipine: Rats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for 2 years at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. The highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of 10 mg on a mg/m2 basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats.\nIn Studies with Atorvastatin: Atorvastatin was not carcinogenic in rats. The maximum dose used was 63-fold higher than the highest human dose (80 mg/day) on a mg/kg body-weight basis and 8- to 16-fold higher based on AUC(0-24) values. In a 2-year study in mice, incidences of hepatocellular adenomas in males and hepatocellular carcinomas in females were increased at the maximum dose used, which was 250-fold higher than the highest human dose on a mg/kg body-weight basis. Systemic exposure was 6- to 11-fold higher based on AUC(0-24).\nAll other chemically similar drugs in this class have induced tumors in both mice and rats at multiples of 12-125 times their highest recommended clinical doses on a mg/kg body-weight basis.\nMutagenesis: In Studies with Amlodipine: Mutagenicity studies revealed no drug-related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels.\nIn Studies with Atorvastatin: Atorvastatin did not demonstrate mutagenic or clastogenic potential in 4 in vitro tests with and without metabolic activation or in 1 in vivo assay. It was negative in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, and in the in vitro HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Atorvastatin did not produce significant increases in chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay and was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test.\nImpairment of Fertility: In Studies with Amlodipine: There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females 14 days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg on a mg/m2 basis).\n*Based on patient weight of 50 kg.\nIn Studies with Atorvastatin: No adverse effects on fertility or reproduction were observed in male rats given doses of atorvastatin up to 175 mg/kg/day or in female rats given doses up to 225 mg/kg/day. These doses are 100-140 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/kg basis. Atorvastatin caused no adverse effects on sperm or semen parameters, or on reproductive organ histopathology in dogs given doses of 10, 40 or 120 mg/kg for 2 years.",

      "dosage": "Dosage: Strictly follow the recommended dosage unless directed otherwise by the physician.\nAdults: Monotherapy (For Previously Treated Patient): Recommended Dosage: 350 mg/m2 administered as an IV infusion over a 30- to 90-min period every 3 weeks.\nCombination Therapy (For Previously Untreated Patients): Safety and efficacy of Campto in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and folinic acid (FA) have been assessed with the following schedule. Recommended Dosage: 180 mg/m2 administered once every 2 weeks as an IV infusion over a 30- to 90-min period, followed by infusion with folinic acid and 5-fluorouracil.\nDosage Adjustment: Campto should be administered after appropriate recovery of all adverse events to grade 0 or 1 NCI-CTC grading (National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria) and when treatment-related diarrhea is fully resolved.\nAt the start of a subsequent infusion of therapy, the dose of Campto, and 5-FU when applicable, should be decreased according to the worst grade of adverse events observed in the prior infusion. Treatment should be delayed by 1-2 weeks to allow recovery from treatment-related adverse events. With the following adverse events, a dose reduction of 15-20% should be applied for Campto and/or 5-FU when applicable: Hematological toxicity, neutropenia grade 4, febrile neutropenia, (neutropenia grade 3-4 and fever grade 2-4), thrombocytopenia and leukopenia (grade 4), nonhematological toxicity (grade 3-4).\nTreatment Duration: Treatment with Campto should be continued until there is an objective progression of the disease or an unacceptable toxicity.\nSpecial Populations: Elderly: No specific pharmacokinetic study have been performed in the elderly. However, the dose should be chosen carefully in this population due to their greater frequency or decreased biological functions. This population should require more intensive surveillance.\nPatients with Impaired Hepatic Function: Monotherapy: In patients with hyperbilirubinemia and prothrombin >50%, the clearance of irinotecan is decreased and therefore, the risk of hematotoxicity is increased. Thus, frequent monitoring of complete blood counts should be conducted in this patient population. In patients with bilirubin up to 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN), the recommended dosage of Campto is 350 mg/m2. In patients with bilirubin ranging from 1.5-3 times the ULN, the recommended dosage of Campto is 200 mg/m2. Patients with bilirubin >3 times the ULN should not be treated with Campto (see Contraindications and Precautions).\nNo data are available in patients with hepatic impairment treated with Campto in combination.\nPatients with Impaired Renal Function: Campto is not recommended for use in patients with impaired renal function, as studies in this population have not been conducted.\nAdministration: Preparation for IV Infusion Administration: As with any other injectable drugs, the Campto solution must be prepared aseptically. If any precipitate is observed in the vials or after reconstitution, it should be discarded according to standard procedures for cytotoxic agents. Aseptically withdraw the required amount of Campto solution from the vial with a calibrated syringe and inject into a 250-mL infusion bag or bottle containing either 0.9% sodium chloride solution or 5% dextrose solution. The infusion should then be thoroughly mixed by manual rotation.\nCampto solution for infusion should be infused into a peripheral or central vein. Campto should not be delivered as an IV bolus or IV infusion <30 min or >90 min.",
      "over-dosage": "Single doses of up to irinotecan 750 mg/m2 have been given to patients with various cancers. The adverse events in these patients were similar to those reported with the recommended dosages and regimens. There have been reports of overdosage at doses up to approximately twice the recommended therapeutic dose, which may be fatal. The most significant adverse reactions reported were severe neutropenia and severe diarrhea. There is no known antidote for Campto. Maximum supportive care should be instituted to prevent dehydration due to diarrhea and to treat any infectious complications.",
      "contra-indications": "Patients with a chronic inflammatory bowel disease and/or bowel obstruction (see Precautions); history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to irinotecan HCl trihydrate or to one of the excipients of Campto; bilirubin >3 times the ULN (see Precautions); severe bone marrow failure. Patients presenting a risk factor, particularly those with a WHO performance status >2.\nUse in pregnancy: Irinotecan is teratogenic in rats and rabbits (see Preclinical Safety Data in Toxicology under Actions). Irinotecan may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of irinotecan in pregnant women.\nIf Campto is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving Campto, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with irinotecan.\nUse in lactation: In rats, radioactivity appeared in the milk within 5 min of IV administration of radiolabeled irinotecan and was concentrated up to 65-fold at 4 hrs after administration relative to plasma concentrations. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants, breastfeeding must be discontinued for the duration of Campto therapy.",
      "special-precautions": "Irinotecan should be administered only under the supervision of a physician who is experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Appropriate management of complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available.\nIrinotecan will only be prescribed in the following cases after the expected benefits have been weighed against the possible therapeutic risks: In patients presenting a risk factor, particularly those with a WHO performance status of 2; in the few rare instances where patients are deemed unlikely to observe recommendations regarding management of adverse events (need for immediate and prolonged antidiarrheal treatment combined with high fluid intake at onset of delayed diarrhea). Strict hospital supervision is recommended for such patients.\nCholinergic Symptoms: Patients may have cholinergic symptoms of rhinitis, increased salivation, miosis, lacrimation, diaphoresis, flushing (vasodilation), bradycardia and intestinal hyperperistalsis that can cause abdominal cramping and early diarrhea (ie, diarrhea generally occurring during or within 8 hrs of administration of irinotecan). These symptoms which may be observed during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan, are thought to be related to the anticholinesterase activity of the irinotecan parent compound and are expected to occur more frequently with higher irinotecan doses. Therapeutic or prophylactic administration of 0.25-1 mg of IV or SC atropine should be considered (unless clinically contraindicated) in patients experiencing cholinergic symptoms.\nExtravasation: While irinotecan is not a known vesicant, care should be taken to avoid extravasation and the infusion site should be monitored for signs of inflammation. Should extravasations occur, flushing the site and application of ice is recommended.\nHepatic: In clinical studies, National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria grade 3 or 4 liver enzyme abnormalities have been observed in <10% of patients. These events typically occur in patients with known hepatic metastases and are not clearly related to irinotecan.\nHematology: Irinotecan commonly causes neutropenia, leukopenia and anemia, any of which may be severe and therefore, should not be used in patients with severe bone marrow failure. Serious thrombocytopenia is uncommon. In clinical studies, the frequency of NCI grade 3 and 4 neutropenia has been significantly higher in patients who received previous pelvic/abdominal irradiation than in those who had not received such irradiation. Patients with baseline serum total bilirubin levels of =1 mg/dL also have had a significantly greater likelihood of experiencing first-cycle grade 3 or 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin levels that were <1 mg/dL. There were no significant differences in the frequency of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia by age or gender. (See Hepatic Insufficiency as follows.)\nNeutropenic fever (concurrent NCI grade 4 neutropenia and =grade 2 fever) occurred in <10% of patients in clinical studies; however, deaths due to sepsis following severe neutropenia have been reported in patients treated with irinotecan. Neutropenic complications should be managed promptly with antibiotic support. Therapy with irinotecan should be temporarily discontinued if neutropenic fever occurs or if the absolute neutrophil count drops <1000/mm3. The dose of irinotecan should be reduced if clinically significant neutropenia occurs.\nPatients with Reduced UGT1A1 Activity: The metabolic conversion of irinotecan to the active metabolite SN-38 is mediated by carboxylesterase enzymes and primarily occurs in the liver. SN-38 subsequently undergoes conjugation to form the inactive glucuronide metabolite SN-38G. This glucuronidation reaction is mediated primarily by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), which is encoded by the UGT1A1 gene. The UGT1A1 gene is highly polymorphic, resulting in variable metabolic capacities among individuals. One specific variation of the UGT1A1 gene includes a polymorphism in the promoter region known as the UGT1A1 variant allele. This variant and other congenital deficiencies in UGT1A1 expression (eg, Crigler-Najjar and Gilbert's syndrome) are associated with reduced enzyme activity and increased systemic exposure to SN-38. Higher plasma concentrations of SN-38 are observed in individuals who are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (also referred to as UGT1A1 7/6 genotype) versus patients who have 1 or 2 wild-type alleles. Data from a meta-analysis of 9 studies involving a total of 821 patients indicate that individuals with Crigler-Najjar syndrome (types 1 and 2) or those who are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (Gilbert's syndrome) are at increased risk of hematological toxicity (grades 3 and 4) following administration of irinotecan at moderate or high doses (>150 mg/m2). A relationship between UGT1A1 genotype and the occurrence of irinotecan-induced diarrhea was not established. Patients known to be homozygous for UGT1A1*28 should be administered the normally-indicated irinotecan starting dose. However, these patients should be monitored for hematologic toxicities. A reduced irinotecan starting dose should be considered for patients who have experienced prior hematologic toxicity with previous treatment. The exact reduction in starting dose in this patient population has not been established and any subsequent dose modifications should be based on individual patient tolerance to treatment.\nHypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions including severe anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, have been reported.\nLate Diarrhea: Late diarrhea (generally occurring >8 hrs after administration of irinotecan) can be prolonged, may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance or sepsis and may be life-threatening. In the clinical studies testing the every 3-week-dosage schedule, the median time to the onset of late diarrhea was 5 days after irinotecan infusion. In the clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule, the median time to onset of late diarrhea was 11 days following administration of irinotecan. For patients starting treatment at the 125 mg/m2 weekly dose, the median duration of any grade of late diarrhea was 3 days. Among those patients treated at the 125 mg/m2 weekly dose who experienced grade 3 or 4 late diarrhea, the median duration of the entire episode of diarrhea was 7 days. Results from a prospective study of the weekly dosage schedule did not demonstrate any difference in the rate of late onset diarrhea in patients =65 years than patients <65 years. However, patients =65 years should be closely monitored due to a greater risk of early diarrhea observed in this population. Colonic ulceration, sometimes with bleeding, has been observed in association with irinotecan-induced diarrhea.\nLate diarrhea should be treated promptly with loperamide at the 1st episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements more frequent than normally expected for the patient. The recommended dosage regimen for loperamide is 4 mg at the 1st onset of late diarrhea and then 2 mg every 2 hrs until the patient is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hrs. During the night, the patient may take loperamide 4 mg every 4 hrs. Loperamide is not recommended to be used for >48 consecutive hrs at these doses, because of the risk of paralytic ileus, nor for <12 hrs. Premedication with loperamide is not recommended. Patients with diarrhea should be carefully monitored and given fluid and electrolyte replacement if they become dehydrated and should be given antibiotic support if they develop ileus, fever or severe neutropenia. In addition to the antibiotic treatment, hospitalization is recommended for management of the diarrhea, in the following cases: Diarrhea associated with fever, severe diarrhea (requiring IV hydration), patients with vomiting associated with delayed (ie, late) diarrhea and persisting diarrhea beyond 48 hrs following the initiation of high-dose loperamide therapy.\nAfter the 1st treatment, subsequent weekly chemotherapy treatments should be delayed in patients until return of pre-treatment bowel function for at least 24 hrs without need for antidiarrheal medication. If NCI grades 2, 3 or 4 diarrhea occurs, subsequent doses of irinotecan should be reduced within the current cycle.\nChronic Inflammatory Bowel Disease and/or Bowel Obstruction: Patients must not be treated with Campto until resolution of the bowel obstruction.\nNausea and Vomiting: Irinotecan is emetogenic. Nausea and vomiting can be severe and usually occurs during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan. It is recommended that patients receive premedication with antiemetic agents. Antiemetic agents should be given on the day of treatment, starting at least 30 min before administration of irinotecan. Physicians should also consider providing patients with an antiemetic regimen for subsequent use as needed. Patients with vomiting associated with delayed diarrhea should be hospitalized as soon as possible for treatment.\nNeurologic: Dizziness has been observed and may sometimes represent symptomatic evidence of orthostatic hypotension in patients with dehydration.\nRenal: Increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen have been observed. There have been cases of acute renal failure. These events have generally been attributed to complications of infection or to dehydration related to nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Rare instances of renal dysfunction due to tumor lysis syndrome have also been reported.\nRespiratory: NCI grade 3 or 4 dyspnea has been observed. The extent to which malignant pulmonary involvement or other preexisting lung disease may have contributed to dyspnea is unknown. A potentially life-threatening pulmonary syndrome, consisting of dyspnea, fever and a reticulonodular pattern on chest x-ray, was observed in a small percentage of patients in early Japanese studies. The contribution of irinotecan to these preliminary events was difficult to assess because these patients also had lung tumors and some had preexisting nonmalignant pulmonary disease.\nInterstitial pulmonary disease presenting as pulmonary infiltrates is uncommon during irinotecan therapy. Interstitial pulmonary disease can be fatal. Risk factors possibly associated with the development of interstitial pulmonary disease include preexisting lung disease, use of pneumotoxic drugs, radiation therapy and colony-stimulating factors. Patients with risk factors should be closely monitored for respiratory symptoms before and during irinotecan therapy.\nOthers: Since Campto contains sorbitol, it is unsuitable in hereditary fructose intolerance.\nSpecial Populations: Hepatic Insufficiency: In patients with hyperbilirubinemia, the clearance of irinotecan is decreased (see Special Populations in Pharmacokinetics under Actions) and therefore, the risk of hematotoxicity is increased. The use of irinotecan in patients with a serum total bilirubin concentration of >3 times institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) given as a single agent on the once-every-3-weeks schedule has not been established. Liver function should be monitored before initiation of treatment and monthly or as clinically indicated.\nIrradiation Therapy: Patients who have previously received pelvic/abdominal irradiation are at increased risk of myelosuppression following the administration of irinotecan. Physicians should use caution in treating patients with extensive prior irradiation. Specific dosing recommendations may apply to this population depending upon the regimen used.\nPerformance Status: Patients with poor performance status are at increased risk of irinotecan-related adverse events. Specific dosing recommendations for patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 may apply depending upon the regimen used. Patients with performance status of 3 or 4 should not receive irinotecan. In patients receiving either irinotecan/5-FU/LV or 5-FU/LV in clinical trials comparing these agents, higher rates of hospitalization, neutropenic fever, thromboembolism, first-cycle treatment discontinuation and early deaths were observed in patients with a baseline performance status of 2 than in patients with a baseline performance status of 0 or 1.\nGastric Cancer: Patients with gastric cancer appear to experience greater myelosuppression and other toxicities when given irinotecan. A lower starting dose should be considered in these patients.\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: Patients should be warned about the potential for dizziness or visual disturbances which may occur within 24 hrs following the administration of Campto and advised not to drive or operate machinery if these symptoms occur.\nUse in the elderly: Specific dosing recommendations may apply to this population depending upon the regimen used.",
      "adverse-reactions": "Clinical Studies: Adverse event data has been extensively collected and analyzed for the clinical studies program in metastatic colorectal cancer that recurred or progressed following 5-FU-based therapy (2nd-line) and are presented as follows (patient population described as follows). The adverse events for other indications are expected to be similar to those for 2nd-line colorectal cancer.\nClinical Studies of the 100- to 125-mg/m2 Single-Agent Weekly Dosage Schedule: The weekly dosage schedule of irinotecan was evaluated in three clinical studies of 304 patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum that had recurred or progressed following 5-FU-based therapy. Five (1.6%) deaths were potentially drug-related. These 5 patients experienced a constellation of medical events (myelosuppression, neutropenic sepsis without fever, small bowel obstruction, fluid accumulation, stomatitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration) that are known effects of irinotecan. Neutropenic fever, defined as NCI grade 4 neutropenia and =grade 2 fever, occurred in 9 other patients; these patients recovered with supportive care.\nEighty-one (26.6%) patients were hospitalized for events judged to be related to administration of irinotecan. The primary reasons for drug-related hospitalization were diarrhea with or without nausea and/or vomiting; neutropenia/leukopenia with or without diarrhea and/or fever; and nausea and/or vomiting.\nAdjustments in the dose of irinotecan were made during the cycle of treatment and for subsequent cycles based on individual patient tolerance. The most common reasons for dose reduction were late diarrhea, neutropenia and leukopenia. Thirteen (4.3%) patients discontinued treatment with irinotecan because of adverse events.\nClinical Studies of the 300- to 350-mg/m2 Once-Every-3-Week Single-Agent Dosage Schedule: A total of 316 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose disease had progressed following prior 5-FU therapy received irinotecan in 2 studies involving once-every-3-week administration. Three (1%) deaths were potentially related to irinotecan treatment and were attributed to neutropenic infection, grade 4 diarrhea and asthenia, respectively. Hospitalizations due to serious adverse events, whether or not related to irinotecan administration, occurred at least once in 60% of patients who received irinotecan and 8% of patients treated with irinotecan discontinued treatment due to adverse events.\nListing of Adverse Events: The drug-related adverse events (NCI grades 1-4) as judged by the investigator that were reported in >10% of the 304 patients enrolled in the 3 studies of the weekly dosage schedule are listed by body system in descending order of frequency as follows: Gastrointestinal Disorders: Late diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, early diarrhea, abdominal cramping/pain, anorexia, stomatitis.\nBlood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Leukopenia, anemia, neutropenia.\nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Asthenia, fever.\nMetabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Decreased weight, dehydration.\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Alopecia.\nVascular Disorders: Thromboembolic events*.\n*Includes angina pectoris, arterial thrombosis, cerebral infarct, cerebrovascular accident, deep thrombophlebitis, embolus lower extremity, heart arrest, myocardial infarct, myocardial ischemia, peripheral vascular disorder, pulmonary embolus, sudden death, thrombophlebitis, thrombosis, vascular disorder.\nNCI grades 3 or 4 adverse events reported in the clinical studies of the weekly and once-every-3-week-dosage schedules (N=620) are listed as follows: NCI Grade 3 or 4 Drug-Related Adverse Events Observed in >10% of Patients in Clinical Studies: Gastrointestinal Disorders: Late diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramping/pain.\nBlood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Leukopenia, neutropenia.\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Alopecia.\nNCI Grade 3 or 4 Drug-Related Adverse Events Observed in 1-10% of Patients in Clinical Studies: Infections and Infestations: Infection.\nGastrointestinal Disorders: Vomiting, early diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, mucositis.\nBlood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Anemia, thrombocytopenia.\nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Asthenia, fever, pain.\nMetabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Dehydration, hypovolemia.\nHepatobiliary Disorders: Bilirubinemia.\nRespiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Dyspnea.\nInvestigations: Increased creatinine.\nNCI Grade 3 or 4 Drug-Related Adverse Events Observed in <1% of Patients in Clinical Studies: Infections and Infestations: Sepsis.\nGastrointestinal Disorders: Rectal disorder, gastrointestinal monilia.\nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Chills, malaise.\nMetabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Decreased weight, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia.\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Rash, cutaneous signs.\nNervous System Disorders: Abnormal gait, confusion, headache.\nCardiac Disorders: Hypotension, syncope, cardiovascular disorders.\nRenal and Urinary Disorders: Urinary tract infection.\nReproductive System and Breast Disorders: Breast pain.\nInvestigations: Increased alkaline phosphatase, increased GGTP.\nThe following additional drug-related events have been reported in clinical studies with irinotecan, but do not meet the criteria as defined previously as either >10% drug-related NCI grades 1-4 or as a NCI grade 3 or 4 drug-related event: Rhinitis, increased salivation, miosis, lacrimation, diaphoresis, flushing, bradycardia, dizziness, extravasation, tumor lysis syndrome and colonic ulceration.\nPost-Marketing Surveillance: Cardiac Disorders: Myocardial ischemic events have been observed following irinotecan therapy predominantly in patients with underlying cardiac disease, other known risk factors for cardiac disease or previous cytotoxic chemotherapy (see also Thromboembolic events in Vascular Disorders under NCI Grades 1-4 Drug-Related Adverse Events Observed in >10% of Patients in Clinical Studies as mentioned previously).\nGastrointestinal Disorders: Infrequent cases of intestinal obstruction, ileus, megacolon or gastrointestinal hemorrhage and rare cases of colitis, including typhlitis, ischemic and ulcerative colitis were reported. In some cases, colitis was complicated by ulceration, bleeding, ileus or infection. Cases of ileus without preceding colitis have also been reported. Rare cases of intestinal perforation were reported.\nRare cases of symptomatic pancreatitis or asymptomatic elevated pancreatic enzymes have been observed.\nHypovolemia: There have been rare cases of renal impairment and acute renal failure, generally in patients who became infected and/or volume-depleted from severe gastrointestinal toxicities.\nInfrequent cases of renal insufficiency, hypotension or circulatory failure have been observed in patients who experienced episodes of dehydration associated with diarrhea and/or vomiting or sepsis.\nImmune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported (see Precautions).\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Early effects eg, muscular contraction or cramps and paresthesia have been reported.\nRespiratory Disorders: Interstitial pneumonia and pneumonitis presenting as pulmonary infiltrates have rarely been observed. Early effects eg, dyspnea have been reported.\nInvestigations: Rare cases of hyponatremia mostly related with diarrhea and vomiting have been reported. Transient and mild to moderate increases in serum levels of transaminases (ie, AST and ALT) in the absence of progressive liver metastasis have been very rarely reported.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "Neuromuscular-Blocking Agents: Interaction between irinotecan HCl and neuromuscular-blocking agents cannot be ruled out. Since Campto has anticholinesterase activity, drugs with anticholinesterase activity may prolong the neuromuscular-blocking effects of suxamethonium and the neuromuscular blockade of nondepolarizing drugs may be antagonized.\nAntineoplastic Agents: The adverse effects of irinotecan eg, myelosuppression and diarrhea, would be expected to be exacerbated by other antineoplastic agents having a similar adverse effect profile.\nDexamethasone: Lymphocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving irinotecan and it is possible that the administration of dexamethasone as antiemetic prophylaxis may have enhanced the likelihood of lymphocytopenia. However, serious opportunistic infections have not been observed and no complications have specifically been attributed to lymphocytopenia.\nHyperglycemia has been observed in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus or evidence of glucose intolerance prior to administration of irinotecan. It is probable that dexamethasone, given as antiemetic prophylaxis, contributed to hyperglycemia in some patients.\nLaxatives: Laxative use during therapy with irinotecan is expected to worsen the incidence or severity of diarrhea.\nDiuretics: Dehydration secondary to vomiting and/or diarrhea may be induced by irinotecan. The physician may wish to withhold diuretics during dosing with irinotecan and during periods of active vomiting or diarrhea.\nAnticonvulsants: Concomitant administration of CYP3A-inducing anticonvulsant drugs (eg, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin) leads to reduced exposure to the active metabolite SN-38. Consideration should be given to starting or substituting non-enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants at least 1 week prior to initiation of irinotecan therapy in patients requiring anticonvulsant treatment.\nKetoconazole: Irinotecan clearance is greatly reduced in patients receiving concomitant ketoconazole, leading to increased exposure to SN-38. Ketoconazole should be discontinued at least 1 week prior to starting irinotecan therapy and should not be administered during irinotecan therapy.\nSt. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum): Exposure to the active metabolite SN-38 is reduced in patients taking concomitant St. John's wort. St. John's wort should be discontinued at least 1 week prior to the first cycle of irinotecan and should not be administered during irinotecan therapy.\nAtazanavir Sulfate: Co-administration of atazanavir sulfate, a CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 inhibitor has the potential to increase systemic exposure to SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. Physicians should take this into consideration when co-administering these drugs.",
      "pregnancy-safe": "Category D: There is positive evidence of human foetal risk, but the benefits from use in pregnant women may be acceptable despite the risk (e.g., if the drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or for a serious disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective).\nCaution For Usage Preparation and Handling: As with other antineoplastic agents, Campto must be prepared and handled with caution. The use of glasses, mask and gloves is required.\nIf Campto solution or infusion solution should come into contact with the mucous membranes, wash immediately with water.\nThe Campto solution should be used immediately after reconstitution as it contains no antibacterial preservative. Campto solution should be used (infusion completed) within 12 hrs at room temperature or within 24 hrs, if stored at 2°-8°C after the first breakage.\nDisposal: All materials used for dilution and administration should be disposed of according to hospital standard procedure applicable to cytotoxic agents.",

      "description": "Each mL of concentrate contains irinotecan HCl trihydrate 20 mg (equivalent to irinotecan 17.33 mg). It also contains the following excipients: Sorbitol, lactic acid and water for injections. The pH of the solution is adjusted to 3.5 with sodium hydroxide.",
      "mechanism": "Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Cytostatic topoisomerase I inhibitor.\n Pharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: The intensity of the major toxicities encountered with Campto (eg, leukoneutropenia and diarrhea) are related to the exposure (AUC) to parent drug and metabolite SN-38.\nSignificant correlations were observed between hematological toxicity (decrease in white cells and neutrophils at nadir) or intensity of diarrhea and both irinotecan HCl and metabolite SN-38 AUC values in monotherapy.\nExperimental Data: Irinotecan is a semisynthetic derivative of camptothecin. It is an antineoplastic agent which acts as a specific inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I. It is metabolized by carboxylesterase in most tissues to SN-38, which was found to be more active than irinotecan in purified topoisomerase I and more cytotoxic than irinotecan against several murine and human tumor cell lines. The inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I by irinotecan or SN-38 induces single-strand DNA lesions which blocks the DNA replication fork and are responsible for the cytotoxicity. This cytotoxic activity was found to be time-dependent and was specific to the S-phase.\nTherapeutic Class: Irinotecan HCl is an antineoplastic agent of the topoisomerase I inhibitor class, clinically investigated as CPT-11. Irinotecan is a semisynthetic derivative of camptothecin, an alkaloid extract from plants eg, Camptotheca acuminata or is chemically synthesized.\nMechanism of Action: Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA and either irinotecan or SN-38.\nIrinotecan serves as a water-soluble precursor of the lipophilic metabolite SN-38. SN-38 is formed from irinotecan by carboxylesterase-mediated cleavage of the carbamate bond between the camptothecin moiety and the dipiperidino side chain. SN-38 is approximately 1000 times as potent as irinotecan as an inhibitor of topoisomerase I purified from human and rodent tumor cell lines. In vitro cytotoxicity assays show that the potency of SN-38 relative to irinotecan varies from 2- to 2000-fold. However, the plasma area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) values for SN-38 are 2-8% of irinotecan and SN-38 is 95% bound to plasma proteins compared to approximately 50% bound to plasma proteins for irinotecan. The precise contribution of SN-38 to the activity of irinotecan is thus unknown. Both irinotecan and SN-38 exist in an active lactone form and an inactive hydroxy acid anion form. A pH-dependent equilibrium exists between the 2 forms such that an acid pH promotes the formation of the lactone, while a more basic pH favors the hydroxy acid anion form.\nPharmacokinetics: Absorption and Distribution: After IV infusion in humans, irinotecan plasma concentrations decline in a multiexponential manner, with a mean terminal elimination half-life of about 6 hrs. The mean terminal elimination half-life of the active metabolite SN-38 is about 10 hrs. The half-lives of the lactone (active) forms of irinotecan and SN-38 are similar to those of total irinotecan and SN-38, as the lactone and hydroxy acid forms are in equilibrium.\nOver the dose range of 50-350 mg/m2, the AUC of irinotecan increases linearly with dose; the AUC of SN-38 increases less than proportionally with dose. Maximum concentrations of the active metabolite SN-38 are generally seen within 1 hr following the end of a 90-min infusion of irinotecan.\nIrinotecan exhibits moderate plasma protein-binding (30-68% bound). SN-38 is highly bound to human plasma proteins (approximately 95% bound). The plasma protein to which irinotecan and SN-38 predominantly binds is albumin.\nMetabolism and Excretion: The metabolic conversion of irinotecan to the active metabolite SN-38 is mediated by carboxylesterase enzymes and primarily occurs in the liver. SN-38 subsequently undergoes conjugation predominantly by the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) to form a glucuronide metabolite. UGT1A1 acitivity is reduced in individuals with genetic polymorphisms that lead to reduced enzyme activity eg, the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism (see Precautions). SN-38 glucuronide had 1/50-1/100 the activity of SN-38 in cytotoxicity assays using 2 cell lines in vitro. The disposition of irinotecan has not been fully elucidated in humans. The urinary excretion of irinotecan is 11-20%; SN-38, <1%; and SN-38 glucuronide, 3%. The cumulative biliary and urinary excretion of irinotecan and its metabolites (SN-38 and SN-38 glucuronide) over a period of 48 hrs following administration of irinotecan in 2 patients ranged from approximately 25% (100 mg/m2) to 50% (300 mg/m2).\nSpecial Populations: Geriatric: The pharmacokinetics of irinotecan administered using the weekly schedule was evaluated in a study of 183 patients that was prospectively designed to investigate the effect of age on irinotecan toxicity. Results from this trial indicate that there are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan, SN-38 and SN-38 glucuronide in patients <65 years compared with patients =65 years. In a study of 162 patients that was not prospectively designed to investigate the effect of age, small (<18%) but statistically significant differences in dose-normalized irinotecan pharmacokinetic parameters in patients <65 years compared to patients =65 years were observed. Although dose-normalized AUC0-24 for SN-38 in patients =65 years was 11% higher than in patients <65 years, this difference was not statistically significant.\nGender: The pharmacokinetics of irinotecan do not appear to be influenced by gender.\nRace: The influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan has not been evaluated.\nHepatic Insufficiency: Irinotecan clearance is diminished in patients with hepatic dysfunction while relative exposure to the active metabolite SN-38 is increased. The magnitude of these effects is proportional to the degree of liver impairment as measured by elevations in serum total bilirubin and transaminase concentrations.\nRenal Insufficiency: The influence of renal insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan has not been evaluated.\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: Irinotecan and SN-38 have been shown to be mutagenic in vitro in the chromosomal aberration test on CHO-cells as well as in the in vitro micronucleus test in mice.\nHowever, they have been shown to be devoid of any mutagenic potential in the Ames test.\nIn rats treated once a week during 13 weeks at the maximum dose of 150 mg/m2 (which is <½ the human recommended dose), no treatment-related tumours were reported 91 weeks after the end of treatment.\nSingle- and repeated-dose toxicity studies with Campto have been carried out in mice, rats and dogs. The main toxic effects were seen in the hematopoietic and lymphatic systems. In dogs, delayed diarrhea associated with atrophy and focal necrosis of the intestinal mucosa was reported. Alopecia was also observed in the dog.\nThe severity of these effects was dose-related and reversible.",

      "dosage": "The dosage is based on the desired effect and on how the patient tolerates Cardace. Therapy is usually long-term. The physician determines the duration of treatment individually for each patients.\nTreatment of Hypertension: Recommended Initial Dose: 2.5 mg once daily. Depending on the response, the dose may be increased. Any increase should be implemented by doubling the dose at intervals of 2-3 weeks. Usual Maintenance Dose: 2.5-5 mg daily. Maximum Dose: 10 mg daily.\nRenal Impairment: Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) 20-50 mL/min/1.73 m2 Body Surface Area: Initial Dose: Generally, 1.25 mg. Maximum Daily Dose: 5 mg. When CrCl cannot be measured, it can be calculated based on the serum creatinine level using the following formula (Cockcroft's equation):\nIn patients with incompletely corrected fluid or salt deficiency, those with severe hypertension, as well as in those for whom a hypotensive reaction would constitute a particular risk (eg, patients with haemodynamically relevant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain) and in the elderly, a reduced initial dose of 1.25 mg daily must be considered.\nPatients Pretreated with a Diuretic: Discontinuing the diuretic for at least 2-3 days or longer, depending on the duration of action of the diuretic, before starting treatment with Cardace, or at least reducing the diuretic dose shoud be considered. The physician will decide in each individual case whether such discontinuation or dose reduction is possible and how long it should last. The initial dose in such patients is generally Cardace 1.25 mg.\nHepatic Impairment: Response to treatment may be either increased or decreased. Therefore, treatment must be initiated only under close medical supervision. Maximum Daily Dose: 2.5 mg.\nTreatment of Congestive Heart Failure: Recommended Initial Dose: 1.25 mg once daily. Depending on the response, the dose may be increased. Any increase should be implemented by doubling the dose at intervals of 1-2 weeks. Maximum Daily Dose: 10 mg.\nThe required daily dose, if =25 mg may be taken as a single dose or in 2 separate doses.\nIn impaired liver or renal function and in patients pretreated with a diuretic, dosage recommendations for Cardace are identical to those given previously in the treatment of hypertension. The recommendations given there in conjunction with diuretic pretreatment also apply.\nTreatment After Myocardial Infarction: Recommended Initial Dose: 5 mg daily, divided into 2 single doses of 2.5 mg each, 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening. If this dose is not well tolerated, 1.25 mg should be taken twice daily over 2 days. In either event depending on the response, the dose may then be increased. Any increase should be implemented by doubling the dose at intervals of 1-3 days. As treatment progresses, the total daily dose may be taken as a single dose. Maximum Daily Dose: 10 mg.\nSufficient experience is still lacking in the treatment of patients with severe heart failure (NYHA IV) immediately after myocardial infarction. Treatment, if nevertheless given, should be started with 1.25 mg once daily and increased only with particular caution.\nIn patients with impaired liver or renal function, with incompletely corrected fluid or salt deficiency, or with severe hypertension, and in those for whom a hypotensive reaction would constitute a particular risk (eg, patients with haemodynamically relevant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain), as well as in those pretreated with a diuretic and in the elderly, the recommendations are identical to those given prevoiusly in treatment of hypertension.\nAdministration: Cardace tablets must be swallowed without chewing and with sufficient amounts of liquid (approximately ½ glass).

      "over-dosage": "Symptoms: Overdosage may cause excessive peripheral vasodilatation (with marked hypotension, shock), bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances and renal failure.\nTreatment: Primary Detoxification eg, gastric lavage, administration of adsorbents and sodium sulfate (if possible during the 1st 30 min). In case of hypotension, administration of a1-adrenergic agonists (eg, norepinephrine, dopamine) and angiotensin II (angiotensinamide) must be considered in addition to volume and salt substitution.",
      "administration": "May be taken with or without food.",
      "contra-indications": "Known hypersensitivity to ramipril, to any other ACE inhibitor or to any of the excipients of Cardace (see Description).\nHistory of angioneurotic oedema (risk of precipitating angioneurotic oedema; see also Adverse Reactions).\nBlood flow reducing and narrowing (haemodynamically relevant stenosis) of the renal artery, bilateral or unilateral in the single kidney (risk of fall in blood pressure and renal failure).\nPatients with low blood pressure or labile circulatory condition (risk of fall in blood pressure and renal failure).\nSince severe rapid-onset and allergy-like (anaphylactoid) hypersensitivity reactions may occur, treatment with ACE inhibitors in conjunction with extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces must be avoided. This latter include dialysis or haemofiltration with certain high-flux membranes (eg, polyacrylonitril membranes) and low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate.\nUse in Pregnancy and Lactation: Cardace must not be taken during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy must be excluded before starting treatment. Pregnancy must be avoided where treatment with ACE inhibitors is indispensable.\nIf a pregnancy is planned, treatment with ACE inhibitors must be discontinued ie, replaced by another form of treatment.\nIf pregnancy occurs during treatment, medication with Cardace must be substituted as soon as possible with a treatment regimen which excluded ACE inhibitors. Otherwise, there is a risk of harm to the fetus. Whether the exposure is limited to the 1st 3 months of pregnancy, possible harmful result to the fetus is not known.\nIf treatment with Cardace is necessary during lactation, breastfeeding must be avoided in order to prevent the infant from ingesting small quantities of ramipril in breast milk.",
      "special-precautions": "Treatment with Cardace requires regular medical supervision.\nIf angioneurotic oedema occurs during treatment (see Adverse Reactions), Cardace must be discontinued immediately and emergency measures must be taken especially if the tongue, glottis or larynx are involved.\nPatients with a hyperstimulated rennin-angiotensin system must be treated with particular caution. ACE inhibition puts such patients at risk of an acute pronounced fall in blood pressure and deterioration of renal function, especially when an ACE inhibitor in combination with a diuretic, a medicine that promotes fluid excretion, is given for the 1st time or for the 1st time at an increased dose.\nTherefore, at the start of treatment with Cardace or after the 1st dose of an additional diuretic, as well as after every 1st increased dose thereof, blood pressure must be closely monitored until such time as no further acute reduction in blood pressure is expected.\nSignificant activation of the rennin-angiotensin system is to be expected eg, patients with severe and particularly malignant hypertension. The initial phase of treatment requires special medical supervision).\nPatients with heart failure particularly if severe or if treated with other potential blood pressure-lowering medicines in severe heart failure, the initial phase of treatment requires special medical supervision.\nPatients with blood flow-reducing (haemodynamically relevant) left-ventricular inflow or outflow impediment (eg, narrowing of the aortic or mitral valve); patients with blood flow reducing and narrowing (haemodynamically relevant stenosis) of the renal artery. The initial phase of treatment requires special medical supervision and concomitant treatment with a diuretic may have to be discontinued.\nPatients pretreated with diuretics, where discontinuation or reduction of diuretic dose is not possible, the initial phase of treatment requires special medical supervision.\nPatients in whom fluid or salt deficiency exists or may develop as a result of inadequate fluid or salt intake, or as a result of eg, diarrhea, vomiting or excessive sweating in cases where salt and fluid replacement is inadequate. Generally, dehydration, reduced blood volume (hypovolaemia) or salt deficiency should be corrected before initiating treatment in patients with heart failure; however, such corrective action must be carefully weighed against the risk of volume overload. When such conditions have become clinically relevant, treatment with Cardace must be started or continued only if appropriate steps are taken concurrently to prevent an excessive fall in blood pressure and deterioration of renal function (see Dosage and Administration).\nAlso, at particular risk from a pronounced fall in blood pressure are eg, patients with haemodynamically relevant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain. Such patients require special medical supervision in the initial phase of treatment as well.\nIn patients with impaired liver function, response to treatment with Cardace may either be increased or decreased. In addition, the renin-angiotensin system may be significantly activated; therefore, in patients with severe liver cirrhosis with oedema and/or ascites; therefore, particular caution must be exercised in treating such patients (see Dosage and Administration).\nRenal function should be monitored, particularly, in the initial weeks of treatment. Particularly, careful monitoring is required in patients with heart failure, renovascular disease (including those with haemodynamically relevant unilateral renal artery stenosis in whom even a small increase in serum creatinine may be indicative of unilateral loss of renal function), in renal impairment, or in kidney transplant patients.\nSerum potassium should be monitored regularly. More frequent monitoring of serum potassium is required in patients with impaired renal function.\nThe white blood cell count should be monitored so that a possible excessive reduction in white blood cells (leucopenia) can be detected. Monitoring should be more frequent in the initial phase of treatment and in patients with impaired renal function, concomitant connective tissue disease (collagen disease eg, lupus erythematosus or scleroderma), or in patients treated with other medicines that may alter the blood picture (see Interactions). The blood picture must be checked if possible signs of reduced white blood cell or platelet counts occur (see Adverse Reactions).\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: Certain adverse effects (eg, some symptoms of reduction in blood pressure eg, lightheadedness, dizziness) may impair the ability to concentrate and react; therefore, constituting a risk in situations where these abilities are of particular importance (eg, operating a vehicle or machinery).\nUse in Elderly: Some elderly patients may be particularly responsive to ACE inhibitors. Renal function should be evaluated at the beginning of treatment (see Dosage and Administration).",
      "adverse-reactions": "Cardiovascular and Nervous System: An excessive reduction in blood pressure may occur particularly after initial or increased doses of Cardace, or of an additional diuretic (see Precautions), and may sometimes progress to shock.\nUncommonly, mild symptoms and reactions eg, headache, disorders of balance, rapid heart rate (tachycardia), weakness, drowsiness, lightheadedness or impaired reactions may occur.\nRarely, mild symptoms and reactions eg, peripheral oedema, flushing, dizziness, noises in the ears (tinnitus), fatigue, nervousness, depressed mood, tremor, restlessness, visual and sleep disturbances, confusion, feeling of anxiety, transient erectile impotence, palpitations, sweating, disturbed hearing, extreme sleepiness (somnolence) or feeling faint on standing or standing up (disturbed orthostatic regulation), as well as severe reactions eg, angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmias and temporary loss of consciousness (syncope) may also occur.\nIn isolated cases, insufficient supply of blood to the heart muscle or to the brain (myocardial or cerebral ischaemia), myocardial infarction, transient reduced blood flow in the brain (transient ischaemic attack), ischaemic stroke, worsening of circulatory disturbances due to vascular stenoses, precipitation or intensification of attacks of circulatory disturbances characterized by eg, whiteness of fingers or toes (Raynaud's phenomenon), or abnormal sensations (paraesthesiae) may occur.\nKidney and Electrolyte Balance: Uncommonly, an increase in serum urea and creatinine (particularly and likely in combination with diuretics). In isolated case, progression of renal function impairment to acute renal failure may develop.\nRarely, an increased in serum potassium may occur. In isolated cases, a decrease in serum sodium may develop, as preexisting pronounced urinary excretion of proteins (proteinuria) may deteriorate (although ACE inhibitors usually reduce proteinuria), or urinary output may increase in conjunction with an improvement in cardiac performance.\nRespiratory Tract, Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid and Skin Reactions: Commonly, a dry (nonproductive) tickling cough occurs. This cough is often worse at night and during periods of recumbency (ie, while reclining), and occurs more frequently in women and non-smokers. It may necessitate complete discontinuation of treatment with ACE inhibitors. Rarely, nasal congestion, inflammation of the nasal sinuses (sinusitis), bronchitis, spasmodic narrowing of the bronchia (bronchospasm) and difficulty in breathing (dyspnoea) may develop.\nUncommonly, the desired ACE inhibition may lead to mild angioneurotic oedema. Swelling of the facial region (eg, lips, eyelids) or of the tongue, throat, or larynx (noticeable, eg, as difficulty in swallowing or breathing) may be signs and symptoms of such a condition. If such signs and symptoms occurs, please inform the physician immediately and stop taking the next scheduled dose of Cardace. Other ACE inhibitors must not be used as an alternative. Serious forms of angioneurotic oedema and other anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions, not attributable to the desired effect, to ramipril or to any of the excipients of Cardace are rare. Angioneurotic oedema in conjunction with ACE inhibitors appears to occur more frequently in Black patients ie, Afro-Caribbean than in non-Black patients. Cutaneous or mucosal reactions eg, rash, itching or urticaria may uncommonly occur.\nIn isolated cases, maculopapular rash, pemphigus, worsening of psoriasis, psoriasiform, pemphigoid or lichenoid exanthema and enanthema, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, pronounced hair loss (alopecia), loosening of the nails (onycholysis), or hypersensitivity of the skin to light (photosensitivity) may occur.\nThe likelihood and severity of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions to insect venoma is increased under ACE inhibition. It is assumed that this effect may also occur in connection with other allergens.\nDigestive Tract: Uncommonly, nausea, increases in hepatic enzymes and/or serum bilirubin, and jaundice due to impaired excretion of bile pigment (cholestatic jaundice) may occur. Rarely, dryness of the mouth, inflammation of the tongue (glossitis), inflammatory reactions of the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract, abdominal discomfort, gastric (including gastritis-like) pain, digestive disturbances, constipation, diarrhoea and vomiting and increased levels of pancreatic enzymes may develop. In isolated cases, inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) or liver damage (including acute liver failure) may occur.\nBlood Picture: A mild (rare) or severe (in isolated cases) reduction in the haemoglobin content or in the blood cell count (red or white blood cells, or platelets) may develop. In isolated cases, a market reduction of white blood cells (agranulocytosis), an excessive reduction in the number of all blood cells (pancytopenia) and impaired blood cell formation (bone marrow depression) may occur. Possible signs of agranulocytosis may include fever, lymph node enlargement or sore throat. Such bleeding tendency due to an excessive reduction in blood platelets (thormbopenia) may include brownish red pin-point spots (petechiae) as well as areas of brownish red discoloration (sometimes rash-like) in the skin or mucous membranes (purpura), or bleeding from the gums which is difficult to control. In isolated cases, a significant reduction in the number of red blood cells due to their increased destruction (haemolytic anaemia) may develop.\nOther Adverse Effects: Uncommonly, conjunctivitis may develop, as muscle cramps, reduced sexual desire (decreased libido), loss of appetite, and disturbances of smell and taste (eg, metallic taste) or partial (sometimes even complete) loss of taste may rarely develop.\nIn isolated cases, inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis), muscle or joint pains (myalgia or arthralgia), fever, an increase in the number of certain white blood cells (eosinophilia), or raised titres of antinuclear antibodies may occur.\nConsult a physician if any of the previously listed adverse effects or any other undesired effects or unexpected changes were noticed. Since some adverse effects (eg, angioneurotic oedema, severe skin reactions, severe changes in the blood picture), may under certain circumstances become life-threatening. It is essential that, if sudden or severe reactions do occur, the patient inform a physician at once.\nClick to view ADR Monitoring Form",
      "interactions": "Extracorporeal treatments involving blood contact with negatively charged surfaces carry the risk of severe anaphylactoid reactions (see Contraindications).\nWhen potassium salts or potassium-retaining diuretics are given concurrently, a rise in serum potassium concentration may occur. Concomitant treatment with potassium-retaining diuretics (eg, spironolactone) or with potassium salts must be accompanied by close monitoring of serum potassium.\nWhen antihypertensive agents (eg, diuretics) or other medicines with blood pressure-lowering potential (eg, nitrates, tricyclic antidepressants, anaesthetics) are used concomitantly, potentiation of the antihypertensive effect is to be anticipated (concerning diuretics, see also Dosage and Administration, Precautions and Adverse Reactions). Serum sodium should be regularly monitored in patients receiving diuretics.\nVasopressor sympathomimetics (eg, adrenaline, noradrenaline) may reduce the antihypertensive effect. Therefore, blood pressure should be monitored particularly closely.\nAllopurinol, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, procainamide, cytostatics and other medicines that may alter the blood picture increase the likelihood of blood picture changes (see Precautions).\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may reduce lithium excretion, possibly increasing its levels in serum and the risk of its toxic effects. Therefore, lithium levels must be monitored.\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may potentiate the effect of antidiabetic agents (eg, insulin or sulfonylurea derivatives). In isolated cases, this may lead to an excessive reduction in blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemic reactions). Therefore, in the initial phase of combined administration, blood sugar levels should be monitored particularly closely.\nConcurrent administration of certain medicines for the control of pain and inflammation (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) eg, acetylsalicylic acid or indomethacin, may weaken the antihypertensive effect. Moreover, combined use may increase serum potassium and the risk of a deterioration of renal function.\nConcomitant use of heparin may lead to an increase in serum potassium concentration.\nCardace may potentiate the effect of alcohol.\nIncreased dietary salt intake may weaken the antihypertensive effect.\nAnaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions to insect venoma and possibly, other allergens are increased under ACE inhibition (see Adverse Reactions).",

      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Ramiprilat, the active metabolite of ramipril, is a potent and long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.\nAdministration of Cardace results in vasodilatation especially in hypertensive patients, and in the reduction of blood pressure. The blood pressure-lowering effect of a single dose occurs within 1-2 hrs after intake, reaching its peak within 3-6 hrs and usually lasts for 24 hrs.\nCardace is also effective in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Further, in patients demonstrating clinical signs of congestive heart failure after an acute myocardial infarction. Cardace has been shown to decrease the mortality risk including the risks of sudden death, progression to severe/resistant heart failure and failure-related hospitalization.\nCardace, when administered on a preventive basis, significantly reduces the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular deaths in patients with an increased cardiovascular risk attributable to vascular diseases (eg, manifest coronary heart disease or a history of stroke or peripheral vascular disease) or to diabetes mellitus with at least 1 additional risk factor [microalbuminuria, hypertension, elevated total cholesterol levels, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, smoking]. Moreover, it reduces total mortality as well as the need for revascularizations, and delays the start and the progression of congestive heart failure. In diabetic and nondiabetic patients, it significantly reduces the occurrence of microalbuminuria and diminishes the risk of development of nephropathy. These effects occur both in hypertensive and in normotensive patients.\nPharmacodynamics: Ramipril is a product which, after absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, is hydrolysed in the liver to from the active ACE inhibitor, ramiprilat, which is a potent and long-acting ACE inhibitor.\nAdministration of ramipril causes an increase in plasma renin activity and a decrease in plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone. The beneficial haemodynamic effects resulting from ACE inhibition are consequences of the reduction in angiotensin II causing dilatation of peripheral vessels and reduction in vascular resistance. There is evidence suggesting that tissue ACE particularly in the vasculature, rather than circulating ACE, is the primary factor determining the haemodynamic effects.\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme is identical with kininase II, one of the enzymes responsible for the degradation of bradykinin. There is evidence that ACE inhibition by ramipril appears to have some effects on the kallikrein-kinin prostaglandin systems. It is assumed that effects on these systems contribute to the hypotensive and metabolic activity of ramipril.\nAdministration of Cardace to hypertensive patients results in reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure. The antihypertensive effects is evident within 1-2 hrs after the drug intake; peak effect occurs 3-6 hrs after drug intake and has been shown to be maintained for at least 24 hrs after usual therapeutic doses.\nPharmacokinetics: Following oral administration, ramipril is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and peak plasma concentrations of ramipril are reached within 1 hr. Peak plasma concentrations of the active metabolite, ramiprilat, are reached within 2-4 hrs.\nPlasma concentrations of ramiprilat decline in a polyphasic manner. The effective t½ of ramiprilat after multiple-once daily administration of ramipril is 13-17 hrs for ramipril 5-10 mg and markedly longer for lower doses of ramipril 1.25-2.5 mg. This difference is related to the long terminal phase of the ramiprilat concentration-time curve observed at very low plasma concentrations. This terminal phase is independent of this dose indicating a saturable capacity of the enzyme to bind ramiprilat. Steady-state plasma concentrations of ramiprilat after once-daily dosing with the usual dose of ramipril are reached by about the 4th day of treatment.\nRamipril is almost completely metabolized and the metabolites are excreted mainly via the kidneys. In addition to the bioactive metabolite, ramiprilat, other inactive metabolites have been identified including diketopiperazine ester, diketopiperazine acid and conjugates.",

Cardura may be used in Blood PressureH patients who are either hyper- or normotensive. While the blood pressure changes in normotensive patients with Blood PressureH are clinically insignificant, patients with hypertension and Blood PressureH have had both conditions effectively treated with Cardura monotherapy.",
      "dosage": "Hypertension: Full Dosage Range: 1-16 mg daily. It is recommended that therapy be initiated at 1 mg given once daily for 1 or 2 weeks. The dosage may then be increased to 2 mg once daily for an additional 1 or 2 weeks. If necessary, the daily dosage should then be increased gradually at similar intervals to 4 mg, 8 mg and a maximum of 16 mg as determined by patient's response to achieve the desired reduction in blood pressure. The usual dose is 2-4 mg once daily.\nBenign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Initial Dosage: 1 mg given once daily. Depending on the individual patient's urodynamics and Blood PressureH symptomatology, dosage may then be increased to 2 mg and thereafter to 4 mg and up to the maximum recommended dose of 8 mg. The recommended titration interval is 1-2 weeks. The usual recommended dose is 2-4 mg once daily.\nElderly: Normal adult dosage is recommended.\nChildren: The safety and efficacy of Cardura in childrena have not been established.\nRenally Impaired Patients: Since the pharmacokinetics of Cardura is unchanged in patients with renal insufficiency, and there is no evidence that Cardura aggravates existing renal dysfunction, the usual dosages may be used in these patients.\nHepatically Impaired Patients: See Precautions.",

The patient should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result should dizziness or weakness occur during the initiation of doxazosin mesylate therapy.\nUse with PDE-5 Inhibitors: Concomitant administration of doxazosin with a PDE-5 inhibitor should be used with caution as it may lead to symptomatic hypotension in some patients.\nHepatic Impairment: As with any drug wholly metabolized by the liver, Cardura should be administered with caution to patients with evidence of impaired hepatic function (see Pharmacokinetics under Actions).\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: The ability to engage in activities eg, operating machinery or a motor vehicle, may be impaired, especially when initiating therapy.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: Although no teratogenic effects were seen in animal testing, reduced fetal survival was observed in animals at extremely high doses. These doses were approximately 300 times the maximum human recommended dose. Animal studies have shown that doxazosin mesylate accumulates in breast milk. As there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant or nursing women, the safety of Cardura during pregnancy or lactation has not yet been established.

It has a molecular weight of 547.6 (free base 451.5).\nDoxazosin mesylate is soluble in dimethylsulfoxide and dimethylformamide; slightly soluble in methanol and sparingly soluble in water (<0.1% at 25°C), ethanol, acetone and chloroform.",
      "mechanism": "Pharmacology: Cardura exerts its vasodilator effect via selective blockade of a1-adrenoceptors located in the vasculature.\nAdministration of Cardura to hypertensive patients causes a clinically significant reduction in blood pressure as a result of a reduction in systemic vascular resistance. With once-daily dosing, clinically significant reductions in blood pressure are present throughout the day and at 24 hrs post-dose. A gradual reduction in blood pressure occurs with maximum reduction usually occurring 2-6 hrs after dosing. In patients with hypertension, blood pressures during treatment with Cardura were similar in both the supine and standing positions. Unlike nonselective a-adrenoreceptor-blocking agents, tolerance has not been observed in long-term therapy with Cardura. Elevations of plasma renin activity and tachycardia were seen infrequently in sustained therapy.\nCardura, in addition to its antihypertensive effect, produce favorable effects on blood lipids, with a significant increase in the HDL/total cholesterol ratio and significant reductions in total triglycerides and total cholesterol. It therefore confers an advantage over diuretics and ß-adrenoceptor-blocking agents which adversely affect these parameters. Based on the established association of hypertension and blood lipids with coronary heart disease, the favorable effects of doxazosin therapy on both blood pressure and lipids indicate a reduction in risk of developing coronary heart disease.\nTreatment with Cardura has been shown to result in regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, inhibition of platelet aggregation and enhanced tissue plasminogen activator capacity. Additionally, Cardura improves insulin sensitivity in patients who have impairment.\nCardura has been shown to be free of adverse metabolic effects and is suitable for use in patients with asthma, diabetes, left ventricular dysfunction and gout.\nAdministration of Cardura to patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (Blood PressureH) results in a significant improvement in urodynamics and symptoms. The effect in Blood PressureH is thought to result from selective blockade of the a-adrenoceptors located in the prostatic muscular stroma, capsule of the prostate and bladder neck.\nPharmacokinetics: Absorption: After oral administration of therapeutic doses, Cardura is well absorbed with peak blood levels occurring at about 2 hrs. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with renal impairment have shown no significant alterations compared to patients with normal renal function. There are only limited data in patients with liver impairment nor studies of the effects of drugs known to influence hepatic metabolism (eg, cimetidine).\nBiotransformation/Elimination: The plasma elimination is biphasic with the terminal elimination half-life being 22 hrs and hence, this provides the basis for once-daily dosing. Cardura is extensively metabolized with <5% excreted as unchanged drug.",

      "special-precautions": "Initiation of treatment should be under the direct supervision of a specialist. Bicalutamide is extensively metabolised in the liver. Data suggest that its elimination may be slower in subjects with severe hepatic impairment and this could lead to increased accumulation of bicalutamide. Therefore, Casodex should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.\nPeriodic liver function testing should be considered due to the possibility of hepatic changes. The majority of changes are expected to occur within the first 6 months of Casodex therapy.\nSevere hepatic changes and hepatic failure have been observed rarely with Casodex and fatal outcomes have been reported (see Adverse Reactions). Casodex therapy should be discontinued if changes are severe.\nBicalutamide has been shown to inhibit cytochrome P-450 (CYP3A4), as such, caution should be exercised when co-administered with drugs metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4 (see Contraindications and Interactions).\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take Casodex.\n50 mg: A reduction in glucose tolerance has been observed in males receiving LHRH agonist.

Periodic liver function testing should be considered (see Warnings and Precautions).\n3May be reduced by concomitant castration.\n4The majority of patients receiving Casodex 150 mg as monotherapy experience gynaecomastia and/or breast pain. In studies these symptoms were considered to be severe in up to 5% of the patients. Gynaecomastia may not resolve spontaneously following cessation of therapy, particularly after prolonged treatment (=1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).\n5Observed in a pharmaco-epidemiology study of LHRH agonist and antiandrogens used in the treatment of prostate cancer.

      "interactions": "In vitro studies have shown that R-bicalutamide is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, with lesser inhibitory effects on CYP2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 activity.\nAlthough clinical studies using antipyrine as a marker of cytochrome P-450 (CYP) activity showed no evidence of a drug interaction potential with Casodex, mean midazolam exposure (AUC) was increased by up to 80% after co-administration of Casodex for 28 days. For drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, such an increase could be of relevance. As such, concomitant use of terfenadine, astemizole and cisapride is contraindicated (see Contraindications) and caution should be exercised with the co-administration of Casodex with compounds eg, ciclosporin and calcium-channel blockers. Dosage reduction may be required for these drugs particularly if there is evidence of enhanced or adverse drug effect. For ciclosporin, it is recommended that plasma concentrations and clinical condition be closely monitored following initiation or cessation of Casodex therapy.\nCaution should be exercised when prescribing Casodex with other drugs which may inhibit drug oxidation eg, cimetidine and ketoconazole. In theory, this could result in increased plasma concentrations of Casodex which theoretically could lead to an increase in side effects.\nIn vitro studies have shown that Casodex can displace the coumarin anticoagulant, warfarin, from its protein-binding sites. It is therefore, recommended that if Casodex is started in patients who are already receiving coumarin anticoagulants, prothrombin time should be closely monitored.\n50 mg: There is no evidence of any pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions between Casodex and LHRH analogues.",

      "mechanism": "Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Antiandrogen. ATC Code: L02BB03.\nPharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: Bicalutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen, devoid of other endocrine activity. It binds to androgen receptors without activating gene expression and thus, inhibits the androgen stimulus. Regression of prostatic tumours results from this inhibition. Clinically, discontinuation of Casodex can result in antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome in a subset of patients.\nCasodex 50 mg is a racemate with its antiandrogenic activity being almost exclusively in the (R)-enantiomer.\nCasodex 150 mg was studied as a treatment for patients with localised (T1-T2, N0 or NX, M0) or locally advanced (T3-T4, any N, M0; T1-T2, N+, M0) nonmetastatic prostate cancer in a combined analysis of 3 placebo controlled, double-blind studies in 8,113 patients, where Casodex was given as immediate hormonal therapy or as adjuvant to radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy (primarily external beam radiation). At 9.7 years median follow-up, 36.6% and 38.17% of all Casodex- and placebo-treated patients, respectively, had experienced objective disease progression.\nA reduction in risk of objective disease progression was seen across most patient groups but was most evident in those at highest risk of disease progression. Therefore, clinicians may decide that the optimum medical strategy for a patient at low risk of disease progression particularly in the adjuvant setting following radical prostatectomy, may be to defer hormonal therapy until signs that the disease is progressing.\nNo overall survival difference was seen at 9.7 years median follow-up with 31.4% mortality (HR=1.01; 95% CI 0.94-1.09). However, some trends were apparent in exploratory subgroup analyses.\nData on progression-free survival and overall survival over time based on Kaplan-Meier estimates for patients with locally advanced disease are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. (See Tables 1 and 2.)\nFor patients with localized disease receiving Casodex alone, there was no significant difference in progression free survival. There was no significant difference in overall survival in patients with localized disease who received Casodex as adjuvant therapy, following radiotherapy (HR=0.98; 95% Cl 0.8-1.2) or radical prostatectomy (HR=1.03; 95% Cl 0.85-1.25). In patients with localized disease, who would otherwise have been managed by watchful waiting, there was also a trend toward decreased survival compared with placebo patients (HR=1.15; 95% Cl 1-1.32). In view of this, the benefit-risk profile for the use of Casodex is not considered favorable in patients with localized disease.\nIn a separate programme, the efficacy of Casodex 150 mg for the treatment of patients with locally advanced nonmetastatic prostate cancer for whom immediate castration was indicated, was demonstrated in a combined analysis of 2 studies with 480 previously untreated patients with nonmetastatic (M0) prostate cancer. At 56% mortality and a median follow-up of 6.3 years, there was no significant difference between Casodex and castration in survival (HR=1.05; CI 0.81-1.36); however, equivalence of the 2 treatments could not be concluded statistically.\nIn a combined analysis of 2 studies with 805 previously untreated patients with metastatic (M1) disease at 43% mortality, Casodex 150 mg was demonstrated to be less effective than castration in survival time (HR=1.3; CI 1.04-1.65), with a numerical difference in estimated time to death of 42 days (6 weeks) over a median survival time of 2 years.\nBicalutamide is a racemate with its antiandrogen activity being almost exclusively in the (R)-enantiomer.\nPharmacokinetics: Bicalutamide is well absorbed following oral administration. There is no evidence of any clinically relevant effect of food on bioavailability.\nThe (S)-enantiomer is rapidly cleared relative to the (R)-enantiomer, the latter having a plasma elimination half-life (t½) of about 1 week.\nOn daily administration of Casodex, the (R)-enantiomer accumulates about 10-fold in plasma as a consequence of its long t½, which also makes it suitable for once daily dosing.\nSteady-state plasma concentrations of the (R)-enantiomer of approximately 22 mcg/mL are observed during daily administration of Casodex 150 mg and 9 mcg/mL during daily administration of Casodex 50 mg. At steady state, the predominantly active (R)-enantiomer accounts for 99% of the total circulating enantiomers.\nThe pharmacokinetics of the (R)-enantiomer are unaffected by age, renal impairment or mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is evidence that for subjects with severe hepatic impairment, the (R)-enantiomer is more slowly eliminated from plasma.\nBicalutamide is highly protein bound [(racemate 96%, (R)-enantiomer >99%)] and extensively metabolised (via oxidation and glucuronidation); its metabolites are eliminated via the kidneys and bile in approximately equal proportions.\nIn a clinical study, the mean concentration of R-bicalutamide in semen of men receiving Casodex 150 mg was 4.9 mcg/mL. The amount of bicalutamide potentially delivered to a female partner during intercourse is low and equates to approximately 0.3 mcg/kg. This is below that required to induce changes in offspring of laboratory animals.\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: Bicalutamide is a potent antiandrogen and a mixed function oxidase enzyme inducer in animals. Target organ changes, including tumour induction (Leydig cells, thyroid, liver) in animals, are related to these activities. Enzyme induction has not been observed in man and none of these findings is considered to have relevance to the treatment of patients with prostate cancer. Atrophy of seminiferous tubules is a predicted class effect with antiandrogens and has been observed for all species examined. Full reversal of testicular atrophy was seen 24 weeks after a 12-month repeated-dose toxicity study in rats, although functional reversal was evident in reproduction studies 7 weeks after the end of an 11-week dosing period. A period of subfertility or infertility should be assumed in man.",

Supportive measures and symptomatic treatment should be given for complications eg, hypotension, renal failure, convulsions, Gastrointestinal irritation and respiratory depression.\nSpecific measures eg, forced diuresis, dialysis, or haemoperfusion are probably of no help in eliminating NSAIDs, including diclofenac, due to high protein-binding and extensive metabolism.\nActivated charcoal may be considered after ingestion of a potentially toxic overdose and gastric decontamination (eg, vomiting, gastric lavage) after ingestion of a potentially life-threatening overdose.",
      "administration": "Should be taken with food: Take before meals.",
      "contra-indications": "Known hypersensitivity to diclofenac or to any of the excipients of Cataflam/Cataflam D.\nActive gastric or intestinal ulcer, bleeding or perforation; severe hepatic, renal and cardiac failure (see Warnings and Precautions).\nPatients who have experienced asthma, urticaria or allergic type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients (see Warnings).\nCataflam/Cataflam D is contraindicated in the treatment of peri-operative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (see Warnings).\nLast trimester of pregnancy (see Use in pregnancy and lactation under Precautions).\nWarnings Cardiovascular Effects: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events: Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to 3 years in duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. All NSAIDs, both COX-2 selective and nonselective, may have a similar risk. Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.\nThere is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID does increase the risk of serious Gastrointestinal events (see text on Gastrointestinal Effects).\nTwo large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke (see Contraindications).\nHypertension: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can lead to an onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events.\nPatients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including diclofenac, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure should be monitored closely during the initiation and throughout the course of NSAID treatment.\nCongestive Heart Failure and Edema: Fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients taking NSAIDs. Cataflam/Cataflam D should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure.\nGastrointestinal Effects: Risk of Ulcerations, Bleeding and Perforations: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause serious Gastrointestinal adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration and perforation of the stomach, small or large intestine, which can be fatal. These various adverse events can occur any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only 1 in 5 patients who develop serious upper Gastrointestinal adverse events while on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper Gastrointestinal ulcers, gross bleeding or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months and in about 2-4% of patients treated for 1 year. This trend continues with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious Gastrointestinal event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.\nNSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or Gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or Gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a >10-fold increased risk of developing Gastrointestinal bleeding compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of Gastrointestinal bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal Gastrointestinal events are in the elderly or in debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.\nTo minimize the potential risk for an adverse Gastrointestinal event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of Gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious adverse event is suspected. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.\nGastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, have been reported with all NSAIDs and may occur at any time during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious Gastrointestinal events. They generally have more serious consequences in the elderly. If Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration occur in patients receiving Cataflam/Cataflam D, it should be withdrawn.\nRenal Effects: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pre-treatment state.\nAdvanced Renal Disease: No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of Cataflam/Cataflam D in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with Cataflam/Cataflam D is not recommended in these patients. If Cataflam/Cataflam D therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.\nAnaphylactoid Reactions: As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to Cataflam/Cataflam D. Cataflam/Cataflam D should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see Contraindications). Emergency help should be sought in cases where anaphylactoid reaction occur.\nAs with other NSAIDs, allergic reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, can also occur in rare cases without earlier exposure due to diclofenac.\nLike other NSAIDs, Cataflam/Cataflam D may mask the sign and the symptoms of infection due to its pharmacodynamic properties.\nSkin Reactions: NSAIDs, including diclofenac, can cause serious skin adverse events (very rarely) eg, exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Patients appear to be at highest risk of these reactions early in the course of therapy, the onset of the reaction occurring in majority of cases within the 1st month of treatment. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and the use of Cataflam/Cataflam D should be discontinued at the 1st appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity.",
      "special-precautions": "General: The concomitant use of Cataflam/Cataflam D with systemic NSAIDs including COX-2 selective inhibitors, should be avoided due to the absence of any evidence demonstrating synergistic benefits and the potential for additive undesirable effects.\nCataflam tablets contain sucrose and therefore are not recommended for patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency.\nPreexisting Asthma: In patients with asthma, seasonal allergic rhinitis, swelling of the nasal mucosa (ie, nasal polyps), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases or chronic infections of the respiratory tract (especially if linked to allergic rhinitis-like symptoms), reactions on NSAIDs eg, asthma exacerbations (so-called intolerance to analgesics/analgesics-asthma), Quincke's oedema or urticaria are more frequent than in other patients. Therefore, special precaution is recommended in such patients (readiness for emergency). This is applicable as well for patients who are allergic to other substances eg, with skin reactions, pruritus or urticaria.\nGastrointestinal Effects: As with all NSAIDs, including diclofenac, close medical surveillance is imperative and particular caution should be exercised when prescribing Cataflam/Cataflam D in patients with symptoms indicative of Gastrointestinal disorders or with a history suggestive of gastric or intestinal ulceration, bleeding or perforation (see Adverse Reactions). The risk of Gastrointestinal bleeding is higher with increasing NSAID doses and in patients with a history of ulcer (particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation) and in the elderly.\nTo reduce the risk of Gastrointestinal toxicity in patients with a history of ulcer (particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation) and in the elderly, the treatment should be initiated and maintained at the lowest effective dose.\nCombination therapy with protective agents (eg, proton-pump inhibitors or misoprostol) should be considered for these patients and also for patients requiring concomitant use of medicinal products containing low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)/aspirin or other medicinal products likely to increase Gastrointestinal risk.\nPatients with a history of Gastrointestinal toxicity, particularly the elderly, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms (especially Gastrointestinal bleeding). Caution is recommended in patients receiving concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding eg, systemic corticosteroids, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents or selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (see Interactions).\nClose medical surveillance and caution should also be exercised in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, as their condition may be exacerbated (see Adverse Reactions).\nHepatic Effects: Close medical surveillance is required when prescribing Cataflam/Cataflam D to patients with impaired hepatic function, as their condition may be exacerbated.\nAs with other NSAIDs, including diclofenac, values of 1 or more liver enzymes may increase. During prolonged treatment with Cataflam/Cataflam D, regular monitoring of hepatic function is indicated as a precautionary measure. If abnormal liver function tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if other manifestations occur (eg, eosinophilia, rash), Cataflam/Cataflam D should be discontinued. Hepatitis may occur with the use of diclofenac without prodromal symptoms.\nCaution is called for when using Cataflam/Cataflam D in patients with hepatic porphyria, since it may trigger an attack.\nRenal Effects: As fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy, including diclofenac, particular caution is called for in patients with impaired cardiac or renal function, history of hypertension, the elderly, patients receiving concomitant treatment with diuretics or medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function, and in those patients with substantial extracellular volume depletion from any cause eg, before and after major surgery (see Contraindications).\nMonitoring of renal function is recommended as a precautionary measure when using Cataflam/Cataflam D in such cases. Discontinuation of therapy is normally followed by recovery to the pre-treatment state.\nHaematological Effects: Use of Cataflam/Cataflam D is recommended only for short-term treatment. If, however, Cataflam/Cataflam D is used for a prolonged period, monitoring of the blood count is recommended, as with other NSAIDs.\nLike other NSAIDs, Cataflam/Cataflam D may temporarily inhibit platelet aggregation. Patients with defects of haemostasis should be carefully monitored.\nEffects on the Ability to Drive and Use Machinery: Patients experiencing visual disturbances, dizziness, vertigo, somnolence or other central nervous system disturbances while taking Cataflam/Cataflam D, should refrain from driving or using machines.\nImpairment of Fertility: As with other NSAIDs, the use of Cataflam/Cataflam D may impair female fertility and is not recommended in women attempting to conceive. In women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility, withdrawal of Cataflam/Cataflam D should be considered.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: The use of diclofenac in pregnant women has not been studied. Therefore, Cataflam/Cataflam D should not be used during the 1st 2 trimesters of pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the foetus. As with other NSAIDs, use of diclofenac during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy is contraindicated owing to the possibility of uterine inertia and/or premature closure of the ductus arteriosus (see Contraindications). Animal studies have not shown any directly or indirectly harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonal/fetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see Toxicology under Actions).\nFollowing oral doses of 50 mg administered every 8 hrs, diclofenac passes into the breast milk in small amounts. Therefore, Cataflam/Cataflam D should not be administered during breastfeeding in order to avoid undesirable effects in the infant.\nUse in the elderly: Caution is indicated in the elderly on basic medical grounds. In particular, it is recommended that the lowest effective dose be used in frail elderly patients or those with low body weight.",

      "interactions": "The following interactions include those observed with Cataflam/Cataflam D and/or other pharmaceutical forms of diclofenac.\nLithium, Digoxin: Cataflam/Cataflam D may raise plasma concentrations of lithium or digoxin. Monitoring of serum lithium or digoxin level is recommended.\nDiuretics and Antihypertensive Agents: Like other NSAIDs, concomitant use of diclofenac with diuretics or antihypertensive agents (eg, ß-blockers, ACE inhibitors) may cause a decrease in their antihypertensive effect. Therefore, the combination should be administered with caution and patients, especially the elderly, should have their blood pressure periodically monitored. Patients should be adequately hydrated and consideration should be given to monitoring of renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy and periodically thereafter, particularly for diuretics and ACE inhibitors due to the increased risk of nephrotoxicity.\nConcomitant treatment with potassium-sparing drugs may be associated with increased serum potassium levels, which should therefore be monitored frequently (see Precautions).\nOther NSAIDs and Corticosteroids: Concomitant administration of diclofenac and other systemic NSAIDs may increase the frequency of side effects (See Warnings and Precaution).\nAnticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents: Caution is recommended since concomitant administration could increase the risk of bleeding (see Warnings and Precautions). Although clinical investigations do not appear to indicate that Cataflam/Cataflam D affects the action of anticoagulants, there are isolated reports of an increased risk of haemorrhage in patients receiving Cataflam/Cataflam D and anticoagulants concomitantly. Close monitoring of such patients is therefore recommended.\nSelective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): Concomitant administration of systemic NSAIDs, including diclofenac, and SSRIs may increase the risk of Gastrointestinal bleeding (see Warnings and Precautions).\nAntidiabetics: Clinical studies have shown that Cataflam/Cataflam D can be given together with oral antidiabetic agents without influencing their clinical effect. However, isolated cases have been reported of both hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic effects necessitating changes in the dosage of hypoglycaemic agents during treatment with diclofenac. For this reason, monitoring of the blood glucose level is recommended as a precautionary measure during concomitant therapy.\nMethotrexate: Caution is recommended when NSAIDs, including diclofenac, are administered <24 hrs before or after treatment with methotrexate since blood concentrations of methotrexate may rise and the toxicity of methotrexate increased.\nCiclosporin: Diclofenac, like other NSAIDs, may increase the nephrotoxicity of ciclosporin due to the effect on renal prostaglandins. Therefore, Cataflam/Cataflam D should be given at doses lower than those that would be used in patients not receiving ciclosporin.\nQuinolone Antibacterials: There have been isolated reports of convulsions which may have been due to concomitant use of quinolones and NSAIDs.\nWarfarin: The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on Gastrointestinal bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious Gastrointestinal bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.",
      "pregnancy-safe": "Category C: Either studies in animals have revealed adverse effects on the foetus (teratogenic or embryocidal or other) and there are no controlled studies in women or studies in women and animals are not available.

      "description": "Cataflam: Each sugar-coated tablet also contains the following excipients: Core: Silica aerogel, calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, pregelatinized maize starch, polyvidone and sodium carboxymethyl starch. Coat: Microcrystalline cellulose, iron oxide, titanium dioxide, macrogol 8000, polyvidone, sucrose and talc.\nDiclofenac potassium is potassium-[0-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-amino-phenyl]-acetate.\nCataflam D: Each dispersible tablet contains diclofenac free acid 46.5 mg which is equivalent to diclofenac sodium 50 mg. It also contains the following excipients: Microcrystalline cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl starch, croscarmellose sodium, silica aerogel, hydrogenated castor oil and talc.\nDiclofenac free acid in Cataflam D is [0-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-amino-phenyl]-acetic acid.",
      "mechanism": "Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products, nonsteroids, acetic acid derivatives and related substances. ATC Code: M01AB05.\nPharmacology: Mechanism of Action: Cataflam contains the potassium salt of diclofenac, a nonsteroidal compound with pronounced analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. Inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis, which has been demonstrated in experiments, is considered to be fundamental to its mechanism of action. Prostaglandins play a major role in causing inflammation, pain and fever.\nCataflam tablets have a rapid onset of action which makes them particularly suitable for the treatment of acute painful and inflammatory conditions.\nDiclofenac potassium in vitro does not suppress proteoglycan biosynthesis in the cartilage at concentrations equivalent to the concentrations reached in humans.\nPharmacodynamics: Cataflam has been found to exert a pronounced analgesic effect in moderate and severe pain. In the presence of inflammation eg, due to trauma or following surgical interventions, it rapidly relieves both spontaneous pain and pain on movement and diminishes inflammatory swelling and wound oedema.\nClinical studies have also revealed that in primary dysmenorrhoea, diclofenac is capable of relieving pain and reducing the extent of bleeding.\nIn migraine attacks, Cataflam has been shown to be effective in relieving headache and in improving the accompanying symptoms of nausea and vomiting.\nPharmacokinetics: Absorption: Diclofenac is rapidly and completely absorbed from Cataflam tablets. The absorption sets in immediately after administration and the same amount is absorbed as from an equivalent dose of diclofenac sodium enteric-coated tablets.\nMean peak plasma concentrations of 3.8 micromol/L are attained 20-60 min after ingestion of one 50-mg tablet. Ingestion together with food has no influence on the amount of diclofenac absorbed, although onset and rate of absorption may be slightly delayed.\nThe amount absorbed is linear in proportion to the size of the dose.\nSince about ½ of diclofenac is metabolized during its 1st passage to the liver (first-pass effect), the AUC is about half as large following oral or rectal administration as it is following a parenteral dose of equal size.\nPharmacokinetic behaviour does not change after repeated administration. No accumulation occurs, provided the recommended dosage intervals are observed.\nDistribution: 99.7% of diclofenac binds to serum proteins, mainly to albumin (99.4%). The apparent volume of distribution calculated is 0.12-0.17 L/kg.\nDiclofenac enters the synovial fluid, where maximum concentrations are measured 2-4 hrs after the peak plasma values have been reached. The apparent t½ for elimination from the synovial fluid is 3-6 hrs. Two hrs after reaching peak plasma levels, concentrations of diclofenac are already higher in the synovial fluid than in the plasma, and they remain higher for up to 12 hrs.\nBiotransformation: Biotransformation of diclofenac takes place partly by glucuronidation of the intact molecule, but mainly by single and multiple hydroxylation and methoxylation, resulting in several phenolic metabolites (3'-hydroxy-, 4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy-diclofenac), most of which are converted to glucuronide conjugates.\nTwo of these phenolic metabolites are biologically active, but to a much lesser extent than diclofenac.\nElimination: Total systemic clearance of diclofenac from plasma is 263±56 mL/min (mean value ±SD). The terminal t½ in plasma is 1-2 hrs. Four of the metabolites, including the 2 active ones, also have short plasma half-lives of 1-3 hrs. One metabolite, 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy-diclofenac, has a longer plasma half-life. However, this metabolite is virtually inactive.\nAbout 60% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as the glucuronide conjugate of the intact molecule and as metabolites, most of which are also converted to glucuronide conjugates. Less than 1% is excreted as unchanged substance. The rest of the dose is eliminated as metabolites through the bile in the faeces.\nCharacteristics in Patients: No relevant age-dependent differences in the drug's absorption, metabolism or excretion have been observed.\nIn patients suffering from renal impairment, no accumulation of the unchanged diclofenac can be inferred from the single-dose kinetics when applying the usual dosage schedule. At a creatinine clearance of <10 mL/min, the calculated steady-state plasma levels of the hydroxy metabolites are about 4 times higher than in normal subjects. However, the metabolites are ultimately cleared through the bile.\nIn patients with chronic hepatitis or nondecompensated cirrhosis, the kinetics and metabolism of diclofenac are the same as in patients without liver disease.\nToxicology: Preclinical Safety Data: Preclinical data from acute and repeated-dose toxicity studies, as well as from genotoxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity studies with diclofenac, revealed no specific hazard for humans at the intended therapeutic doses. There was no evidence that diclofenac had a teratogenic potential in mice, rats or rabbits.\nDiclofenac did not influence the fertility of the parent animals in rats. The pre-, peri- and postnatal development of the offspring was not affected.",

In hypertension caused by phaeochromocytoma, no therapeutic effect of Catapres can be expected.\nAs with other antihypertensive drugs, treatment with Catapres should be monitored particularly carefully in patients with heart failure or severe coronary heart disease.\nPatients should be instructed not to discontinue therapy without consulting the physician. Following sudden discontinuation of Catapres after prolonged treatment with high doses, restlessness, palpitations, rapid rise in blood pressure, nervousness, tremor, headache or nausea have been reported. When discontinuing therapy with Catapres, the physician should reduce the dose gradually over 2-4 days.\nIf long-term treatment with a ß-receptor blocker has to be interrupted, the ß-receptor blocker should first be phased out gradually and then clonidine.\nEffects on the Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery: The ability to drive or operate machinery may be impaired by Catapres.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: During pregnancy, Catapres, as any drug, should only be administered if clearly needed.\nCareful monitoring of mother and child is recommended.\nClonidine passes the placental barrier and may lower the heart rate of fetus. Postpartum and transient rise in blood pressure in the newborn cannot be excluded.\nDuring pregnancy, the oral forms of Catapres should be preferred. IV injection of clonidine should be avoided.\nThere is no adequate experience regarding the long-term effects of prenatal exposure.\nThe use of Catapres during lactation is not recommended due to a lack of supporting information.\nSide Effects Most side effects are mild and tend to diminish with continued therapy.\nFrequent side effects are dryness of the mouth and sedation.\nOccasionally constipation, nausea and vomiting, headache, malaise, impotence, decreased libido, gynaecomastia, orthostatic complaints, paresthesia of the extremities, Raynaud's phenomenon, pain in the parotid gland, drying out of the nasal mucosa and reduced lacrimal flow (contact lens wearers should be cautioned) as well as skin reactions with symptoms eg, rash, urticaria, pruritus and alopecia have been observed. Sleep disturbances, nightmares, depression, perceptual disorders, hallucinations, confusion and disturbances of accommodation may occur.\nIn very rare cases, pseudo-obstruction of the large bowel has been observed in predisposed patients.\nClonidine may cause or potentiate bradyarrhythmic conditions eg, sinus bradycardia or Atrioventricular block.\nRarely, transient elevations of blood sugar levels have been reported.",
