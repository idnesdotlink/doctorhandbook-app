+ reduce dosage in patients with renal impairment.
+ do not combine with potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone) or potassium.
+ monitor, if possible, serum creatinine and potassium levels (hyperkalaemia is frequent but of no concern if it remains below 5.5 meq/litre).
+ in patients taking a diuretic, reduce the dose of the diuretic when adding enalapril.
