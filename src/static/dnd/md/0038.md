+ hepatic enzyme inducers (rifampicin, rifabutin, nevirapine, ritonavir, phenobarbital, phenytoin,  carbamazepine, griseofulvin, etc.) reduce the contraceptive efficacy. use copper intrauterine device or condoms or injectable medroxyprogesterone.

+ *breast-feeding*: it is recommended to wait 6 weeks after childbirth before starting desogestrel in breastfeeding women. however, if it is the only contraceptive method available or acceptable, it can be started 3 weeks after childbirth.

### remarks
+ desogestrel is a possible alternative when estroprogestogens are contra-indicated or poorly tolerated. it is preferred to levonorgestrel as its contraceptive efficacy is similar to that of estroprogestogens.
+ if a woman misses a tablet, she should take it as soon as possible and continue treatment as normal. if she misses by over 12 hours, contraceptive protection will be lessened. it is therefore recommended to use an additional contraceptive method: condoms for 7 days and, if she has had sexual intercourse within 5 days before forgetting the tablet, emergency contraception.
