the dosage varies from one person to another. the initial dose depends on the severity of symptoms. it may be increased or reduced over time. always try to administer the lowest effective dose. for information:

shake the inhaler. breathe out as completely as possible. place the lips tightly around the mouthpiece.

inhale deeply while activating the inhaler. hold breath 10 seconds before exhaling. verify that the inhalation technique is correct.

co-ordination between the hand and inhalation is very difficult in certain patients (children under 6 years, elderly patients, etc.). use a spacer to facilitate administration and improve the efficacy of treatment.

### contra-indications, adverse effects, precautions
+ do not administer to patients with untreated active tuberculosis.
+ may cause: throat irritation, hoarseness at the beginning of treatment, oro-pharyngeal candidiasis.
+ in the event of cough and/or bronchospasm following inhalation of beclometasone: administer salbutamol if necessary, stop inhalation of beclometasone and replace with an oral corticoid.
