# morphine sustained-release (msr)

### notes
+ prescription under medical supervision

### therapeutic action
+ centrally acting opioid analgesic

### indications
+ severe and persistent pain, especially cancer pain

### presentation
+ 10 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg sustained-release capsules or tablets

### dosage
+ usually, the effective daily dose is determined during the initial treatment with immediate-release morphine (mir). when changing from mir to msr, the daily dose remains the same. for example, if the effective dose of mir is 20 mg 6 times/day (120 mg/day), the dose of msr is 60 mg 2 times/day (120 mg/day).
+ if treatment is initiated directly with msr:  
    - child over 6 months: initially 1 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses at 12-hour intervals  
    - adult: initially 60 mg/day in 2 divided doses at 12-hour intervals  
        adjust the dose if necessary, increasing the dose by 50% per day until pain relief is obtained.
+ patients stabilized on msr may require rescue doses of mir in the event of episodic (breakthrough) pain. a rescue dose corresponds to 10% of the daily msr dose. if a patient regularly requires more than 3 rescue doses per day, increase the daily msr dose by the sum of rescue doses.

### duration
+ according to clinical response. do not stop long-term treatment abruptly. decrease doses progressively to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

### contra-indications, adverse effects, precautions
+ do not administer to patients with severe respiratory impairment or decompensated hepatic impairment.
+ do not initiate treatment with the sustained-release formulation in elderly patients or those with renal or hepatic impairment. begin treatment with the immediate release formulation (mir).
+ may cause:
    - dose-related sedation and respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, constipation, urinary retention, confusion, raised intracranial pressure, pruritus;
    - in the event of overdose: excessive sedation, respiratory depression, coma.
+ management of respiratory depression includes assisted ventilation and/or administration of naloxone. monitor patient closely for several hours.
+ administer with caution to patients with respiratory impairment, head injury, raised intracranial pressure, uncontrolled epilepsy or urethroprostatic disorders.
+ do not combine with opioid analgesics with mixed agonist-antagonist activity such as buprenorphine, nalbuphine, pentazocine (competitive action).
+ increased risk of sedation and respiratory depression, when combined with alcohol and drugs acting on the central nervous system: benzodiazepines (diazepam, etc.), neuroleptics (chlorpromazine, haloperidol, etc.), antihistamines (chlorphenamine, promethazine), phenobarbital, etc.
+ *pregnancy and breast-feeding*: no contra-indication. the child may develop withdrawal symptoms, respiratory depression and drowsiness when the mother receives morphine at the end of the 3rd trimester and during breast-feeding. in these situations, administer with caution, for a short period, at the lowest effective dose, and monitor the child.

### remarks
+ administer an appropriate laxative (e.g. lactulose) if analgesic treatment continues more than 48 hours.
+ do not crush or chew capsules. they can be opened and emptied into food.
+ morphine is on the list of narcotics: follow national regulations.
+ storage: below 25Â°
