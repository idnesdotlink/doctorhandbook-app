+ administer with caution and monitor use in patients > 60 years and patients with parkinson's disease, cardiac, hepatic or renal impairment.
+ may cause: orthostatic hypotension, hyperprolactinaemia, sexual dysfunction, extrapyramidal syndrome, tachycardia, headache, nausea, agitation, anxiety, insomnia, drowsiness (inform patients that it may affect their capacity to drive/operate machinery); neuroleptic malignant syndrome (unexplained hyperthermia with neuromuscular disorders), rare but requiring immediate treatment discontinuation.
+ in the event of extrapyramidal symptoms, combine with biperiden.
+ avoid or monitor combination with: fluoxetine, carbamazepine, rifampicin, furosemide, antihypertensives, cns depressants (opioid analgesics, sedatives, h1 antihistamines, etc.).
+ avoid alcohol during treatment.
+ *pregnancy*: re-evaluate whether the treatment is still necessary; if it is continued, haloperidol or chlorpromazine are in principle preferred as they are better known. however, if it is difficult to change treatment at the beginning of pregnancy or if pregnancy is already in second trimester, risperidone can be maintained. observe the newborn infant the first few days (risk of hypertonia, tremors, sedation).
+ *breast-feeding*: no contra-indication
