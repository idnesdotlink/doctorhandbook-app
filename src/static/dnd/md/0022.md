### contra-indications, adverse effects, precautions
+ do not administer to patients with atrioventricular block, history of bone marrow depression.
+ administer with caution to patients with glaucoma, urinary retention, hepatic or renal impairment, heart failure or blood disorders and to elderly patients.
+ may cause:
    - headache, dizziness, gastrointestinal and visual disturbances, rash, leucopenia, confusion and agitation in elderly patients, drowsiness (use with caution when driving or operating machinery);
    - rarely: severe allergic reactions (lyell's and stevens-johnson syndromes), agranulocytosis, anaemia, bone marrow depression, pancreatitis, hepatitis, cardiac conduction defect. in these cases, stop treatment.
+ do not drink alcohol during treatment.
+ do not combine or monitor the combination with:
    - erythromycin, isoniazid, fluoxetine, valproic acid, etc. (increased carbamazepine plasma concentrations);
    - rifampicin (reduced efficacy of carbamazepine);
    - oral anticoagulants, oestroprogestogens (intrauterine device is preferred), corticosteroids, tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptics, protease inhibitors, rifampicin, itraconazole, doxycycline, tramadol, etc. (reduced efficacy of these drugs).
+ *pregnancy*:
    - epilepsy: do not start treatment during the first trimester, except if vital and there is no alternative (risk of neural tube defects, facial and cardiac malformations, hypospadias). however, if treatment has been started before the pregnancy, do not stop treatment and use the minimal effective dose. due to the risk of haemorrhagic disease of the newborn, administer vitamin k to the mother and the newborn infant. the administration of folic acid during the first trimester may reduce the risk of neural tube defects.
    - neuropathic pain: not recommended
