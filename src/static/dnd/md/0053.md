haloperidol, risperidone, phenytoin (increases they toxicity), drugs which lower the seizure threshold
(antispychotics, mefloquine, tramadol, etc.), lithium and other serotonergics.

sleeping disorders, etc.).

### remarks
+ do not open the capsules.

efficacy. this must be explained to the patient.
+ in case of insufficient response after 4 weeks, dosage may be increased to 40 mg/day, except in patients
with hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment.
+ in elderly patients, ssri are preferred to tricyclics (less contraindications, less adverse effects).
