    - severe renal or hepatic function impairment; allergy to sulphonamides.
+ may cause:
    - hypoglycaemia due to excessive doses, especially in elderly patients; insufficient intake of sugar;
hepatic or renal failure. treat mild hypoglycaemia with intake of oral sugar and iv injection of
hypertonic glucose solution if severe; adjust dosage;
    - allergic reactions.
+ avoid combination with: co-trimoxazole, aspirin and other anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-blockers (risk
of hypoglycaemia), barbiturates, glucocorticoids, oral contraceptives (antagonise hypoglycaemic effect),
