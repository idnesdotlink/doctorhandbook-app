# Basal Cell Carcinoma

![3](static/expanded/dnt/image/0003.jpg)

Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma begins in the basal cells â€” a type of cell within the skin that produces new skin cells as old ones die off.

Basal cell carcinoma often appears as a slightly transparent bump on the skin, though it can take other forms. Basal cell carcinoma occurs most often on areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun, such as your head and neck.

Most basal cell carcinomas are thought to be caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight. Avoiding the sun and using sunscreen may help protect against basal cell carcinoma.
