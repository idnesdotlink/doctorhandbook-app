# Vaginal Cancer

## Overview

Vaginal cancer is a rare cancer that occurs in your vagina â€” the muscular tube that connects your uterus with your outer genitals. Vaginal cancer most commonly occurs in the cells that line the surface of your vagina, which is sometimes called the birth canal.

While several types of cancer can spread to your vagina from other places in your body, cancer that begins in your vagina (primary vaginal cancer) is rare.

A diagnosis of early-stage vaginal cancer has the best chance for a cure. Vaginal cancer that spreads beyond the vagina is much more difficult to treat.

## Symptomps

Early vaginal cancer may not cause any signs and symptoms. As it progresses, vaginal cancer may cause signs and symptoms such as:

+ Unusual vaginal bleeding, for example, after intercourse or after menopause
+ Watery vaginal discharge
+ A lump or mass in your vagina
+ Painful urination
+ Frequent urination
+ Constipation
+ Pelvic pain

## Causes

It's not clear what causes vaginal cancer. In general, cancer begins when healthy cells acquire a genetic mutation that turns normal cells into abnormal cells.

Healthy cells grow and multiply at a set rate, eventually dying at a set time. Cancer cells grow and multiply out of control, and they don't die. The accumulating abnormal cells form a mass (tumor).

Cancer cells invade nearby tissues and can break off from an initial tumor to spread elsewhere in the body (metastasize).

## Types

Vaginal cancer is divided into different types based on the type of cell where the cancer began. Vaginal cancer types include:

+ **Vaginal squamous cell carcinoma**, which begins in the thin, flat cells (squamous cells) that line the surface of the vagina, and is the most common type
+ **Vaginal adenocarcinoma**, which begins in the glandular cells on the surface of your vagina
+ **Vaginal melanoma**, which develops in the pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) of your vagina
+ **Vaginal sarcoma**, which develops in the connective tissue cells or muscles cells in the walls of your vagina
