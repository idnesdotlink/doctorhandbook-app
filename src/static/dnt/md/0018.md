# Esophageal Cancer

![18](static/expanded/dnt/image/0018.jpg)

Esophageal cancer is cancer that occurs in the esophagus â€” a long, hollow tube that runs from your throat to your stomach. Your esophagus helps move the food you swallow from the back of your throat to your stomach to be digested.

Esophageal cancer usually begins in the cells that line the inside of the esophagus. Esophageal cancer can occur anywhere along the esophagus. More men than women get esophageal cancer.

Esophageal cancer is the sixth most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Incidence rates vary within different geographic locations. In some regions, higher rates of esophageal cancer cases may be attributed to tobacco and alcohol use or particular nutritional habits and obesity.

## Sign And Symptomps

Signs and symptoms of esophageal cancer include:

+ Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
+ Weight loss without trying
+ Chest pain, pressure or burning
+ Worsening indigestion or heartburn
+ Coughing or hoarseness
+ Early esophageal cancer typically causes no signs or symptoms.

## When To See Doctors

Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you.

If you've been diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus, a precancerous condition that increases your risk of esophageal cancer caused by chronic acid reflux, ask your doctor what signs and symptoms to watch for that may signal that your condition is worsening.

Screening for esophageal cancer isn't done routinely except for patients with Barrett's esophagus because of a lack of other easily identifiable high-risk groups. If you have Barrett's esophagus, discuss the pros and cons of screening with your doctor.

## Causes

It's not exactly clear what causes esophageal cancer.

Esophageal cancer occurs when cells in your esophagus develop errors (mutations) in their DNA. The errors make cells grow and divide out of control. The accumulating abnormal cells form a tumor in the esophagus that can grow to invade nearby structures and spread to other parts of the body.
